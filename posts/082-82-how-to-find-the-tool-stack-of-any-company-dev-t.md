# Developer marketing insights
### 1. New dev tools user research newsletter (+ learnings)
[Shili Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shilili/) is a user research advisor helping dev tools. Ex Apollo GraphQL, ex AWS, ex Auth0 to name a few. Knows her stuff. 
She launched a newsletter recently, [“Dev Tools Research”](https://shili.substack.com/) where she shares gold after gold. Read everything she published so far. 
My takeaways from the first 4 issues.
[Usability research techniques for developer led growth](https://shili.substack.com/p/dev-tools-usability-research-techniques): 
  * Three **core questions devs want to answer** when evaluating: What does the product do, How much does it cost, How hard is it to integrate
  Ask devs to complete sentences** like: “The three primary benefits of this product are…”, “This product is best for…” and similar
  * To see how easy people expect things to be ask the questions “What does an ideal hello world look like” and **“What do you expect to accomplish in 1 hour? “**

[Journey mapping interviews: a structured approach to analyzing the onboarding experience](https://shili.substack.com/p/journey-mapping-interviews-dev-tools): 
  * You want to create a **dev journey map with key moments** (start searching, signup, activation etc) and triggers, pain points, and barriers for each
  * Find 5-10 people who are activated and 5-10 who aren’t. Comparing them reveals insights
  * Ask **“how easy was it to choose a pricing plan on a scale of 1-10”**. Follow-up with why. 
  * There is a great list of 9 questions to ask during each interview. Use them during each interview but you may want to double-click on answers or skip when don’t apply/don’t add much to what you already know. 

[Usability Test Case Study with Stytch: Part I and Part II](https://shili.substack.com/p/usability-test-case-study-with-stytch)
  * This is a fantastic case study showing how to do this sort of research properly
  * Dev exploring the website looked at the live code snippets, docs, pricing, and the vs alternative comparison page. By the way, those comparison pages are something I feel the founders underestimated. [I wrote about it here.](https://www.markepear.com/blog/dev-tool-comparison-page)
  * Seeing real devs navigate your site and what they are actually excited about makes finding improvement ideas clear. You just feel the reactions of devs to certain things like live apps or code. 

### 2. My developer marketing podcast playlist

Recently I was talking to someone who followed me and they asked for podcast recommendations. 
And realized that I haven’t mentioned [my developer marketing playlist ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/58WTT1mkiaawmNO34fNuBZ?si=8380bf73e04e4d3f&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=82-how-to-find-the-tool-stack-of-any-company-dev-tool-user-research-and-a-dev-marketing-playlist)here or on LinkedIn in a long long time. 
So here it is:
  * Podcast episodes about dev marketing, GTM, sales, devrel
  * Each episode I actually listened to and learned something from
  * 147 episodes and counting (I add something every week)

Thought you might like it.

### 3. How do you find the tool stack of virtually any company?
Gonto from Hypergrowth Partners wrote a great article on [“Mastering Developer-Led Outbound”](https://playbooks.hypergrowthpartners.com/p/mastering-developer-led-outbound).
There are a few great insights in there but the one that I found brilliant was how you can find out what the tool stack pretty much any company has internally. 
**You can do that by going over their Terms and Conditions.** Companies need to provide that info. Especially big enterprises that care about compliance. 
You can do that at scale with scraping and automation. 
Then you reach out to companies that are a good fit for tool replacement/upgrade/addition. 
Never thought of it before but will use it now.
