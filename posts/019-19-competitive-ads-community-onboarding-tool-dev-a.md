# Developer marketing insights

## 1. Vs Competitor Twitter Ad from Convex

Competitive ads challenging developers to consider alternatives are difficult but achievable. The challenge lies in listing competitor problems without appearing overly negative or making unfounded claims.

**Convex executed this well by:**

- **Opening positively**: Acknowledging that "some people do Love Firebase"
- **Building credibility**: Tagging the competitor directly
- **Using customer voice**: Listing real pain points like "request waterfalls," "weak react support," and "managing end-to-end consistency"
- **Providing depth**: Linking to detailed comparison resources

The approach resonated with hundreds of developers despite its aggressive positioning, demonstrating that authenticity and third-party validation overcome skepticism in dev marketing.

## 2. Dots - Community Platform Automation

**Solution**: Automation and insights tool for Discord and Slack communities

**Positioning**: "Build amazing community experiences on Discord & Slack. Delight your members with interactive onboarding and support flows, and save time with detailed insights & various automations."

This addresses a specific need for community builders seeking scalable engagement without requiring extensive manual coordination.

## 3. Infrastructure Team's Mindset

A notable insight from developer infrastructure perspectives: teams want pre-built solutions that feel custom-built for their specific use case. Generic solutions face skepticism regardless of capability.

**Strategic implication**: Create educational content—ideally from developer voices—showing how to solve problems without your product first, then present your solution as addressing the identified gaps. This builds trust that your tool addresses real needs rather than manufactured problems.
