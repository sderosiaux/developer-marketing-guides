I really like how [Achintya Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/achintyagupta/) and the [Reo.Dev](http://Reo.Dev) team dissects developer sales in their [“Developer led growth” newsletter](https://reodotdev.substack.com/). 
A lot of great insights in there including a deep dive into modern developer-led GTM. 
Here is a tldr. 
**What is “Modern developer-led GTM” about: It acknowledges 2 very different personas involved in the purchase process, a Developer and a Buyer.
  * It is neither bottom-up nor top-down, but hybrid.
  * It is collaborative and assumes coordination between teams (product/devrel/marketing/sales).

**And because of that, you need to: Think Account First; Lead Second
  * Understand who is a buyer and who is a user from your lead database
  * Setup a Developer Database to Nurture Developers from aspirational accounts
  * Analyse and Strategise Account Entry based on Accounts with Relevant Developer Activity
  * Collaborate and Close

### 2. Flatfile office hours CTA in the docs
So you set up office hours with your product team and you want to get as many users/customers/prospects to show up on a weekly basis. 
Btw, I really like the concept of office hours.
  * You give people the option to "get a demo" and answer their questions
  * But you don't make them schedule anything, they can just come (or not)

You get your devrels or product to do those weekly and then you just have to figure out how to get people there.
Classic options are to put info in onboarding sequences, in the app, or on the website hello bar.
But Flatfile had another idea. They put it in [their docs homepage](https://flatfile.com/docs/quickstart/meet-the-workbook) header.
