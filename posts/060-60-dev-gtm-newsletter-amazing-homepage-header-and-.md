# Developer marketing insights
### 1. New “Developer GTM” newsletter
There is a new dev-focused newsletter in town (yass!). 
[Paige Paquette](https://twitter.com/PaigePaquette) and [Ceci Stallsmith](https://twitter.com/CeciStalls) are putting together a series of interviews with some dev-focused GTM heavy-hitters and packaging it as a [”Developer GTM” newsletter.](https://calyx.substack.com/)
Here are the first 3 issues + one quote from each to give you a taste. 
[#1 DevRel: What to avoid, when to hire, and how to succeed](https://calyx.substack.com/p/devrel-what-to-avoid-when-to-hire)
**How do you know when you’re ready to hire DevRel?**
_“When the people already doing the components of DevRel that would be owned by a DevRel person can no longer sustain it!_
_…_
_By the time you hire your first DevRel, someone was already doing the work, just ad-hoc and reactively, and now you want to put some more structure and strategy around it so get ahead of the ball.”_
Bear Douglas, DevRel Lead at Pinecone, ex Twitter/Facebook/Slack 
[#2 How to make better decisions through research (and when you should go with your gut)](https://calyx.substack.com/p/how-to-make-better-decisions-through)
_“A common trap startups fall into is they decide they want to do more research, and then just go chronologically – “let’s do research for the next thing we’re shipping!”_
_Instead, you should look at your next 6 months or 1 year. Ask yourself, “if I could increase my confidence on 2-3 things on this roadmap, what would those things be?” ”_
Behzod Sirjani, Founder Yet Another Studio, ex Slack/Facebook 
[#3 Proven (and Practical!) Strategies for Building Successful Communities](https://calyx.substack.com/p/proven-and-practical-strategies-for)
_“The biggest mistake is growing too fast without having solid cohorts of community elders,_
_…_
_If you grow too fast, you don't have the time to build the relationships you need with the people who are going to be your top contributors and who are going to help you grow and scale the community. “_
Elizabeth Kinsey, Community lead Braze, ex Slack/Branch 
Definitely worth subscribing to.
