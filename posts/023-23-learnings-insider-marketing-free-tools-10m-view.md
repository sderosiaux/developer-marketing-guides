[Read on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7048682477434875904/)
[Kevin Chiu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kchiu1/) was the Head of Sales and RevOps at DigitalOcean back in 2015/2016. 
In this post (that got 600+ likes and 50+ comments) he shares what made DO grow so quickly in a competitive market. 
This is what he said was crucial to their growth:
  Radical Product Market Fit** : they were laser-focused on individual devs and SMBs
  UX, simplicity & ease of use**: devex was how they broke into an established category
  Community and brand** : they gave “love” to the community with content and tools and developers loved them back (and still do)
  Investing in customer success not sales**. Growing dev accounts through more adoption is easier than convincing devs to buy 
  * Strong (internal) **RevOps tooling** to align GTM teams on a common reality.

### 2. Marketing through free tools
Marketing through free tools is powerful. And Auth0 implemented it beautifully.
In an **[old article from Gonto](https://gon.to/2018/12/13/content-products-the-new-way-of-doing-content-marketing)** I read about some free tools that Auth0 created years ago.
And those tools are still generating traffic and leads today.
And they are helpful to developers and make the Auht0 brand even more appreciated by the community.
One of those tools is [JSON Web Token Debugger](https://jwt.io/).
