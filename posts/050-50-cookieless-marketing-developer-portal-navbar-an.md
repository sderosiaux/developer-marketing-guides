# Developer marketing insights
### 1. The world with no (advertising) cookies
There are companies that talk. There are companies that do. 
And then there are some who do and then write about it. [Sentry](https://sentry.io) is one of these. 
[ We removed advertising cookies, & here’s what happened | Sentry Since our removal of cookies, we’ve seen both positive & negative effects. Learn more about our experience of going cookieless here. blog.sentry.io/we-removed-advertising-cookies-heres-what-happened ![](https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/DLMm5a74QVVYOHHzRggzf/d660a343665477b85c9a6b001a8406c8/partner-webinar-art-meta__1_.jpg) ](https://blog.sentry.io/we-removed-advertising-cookies-heres-what-happened/)
Amazing article, here are my takeaways:
  Third-party cookies will be deprecated** by Google this year (most likely) -> prepare
  Attribution and reporting** will get harder different: you need to rely more on self-reported attribution, UTMS, referrer and landing page segments (this is a [great additional reading on this](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/3-part-marketing-attribution-framework-plg/) btw)
  * Remarketing changes from **cookie-based to engagement-based **Classic*display remarketing may die** (for you) completely 
  Engagement retargeting may deliver better results** as you optimize on platform-specific engagement metrics 
  * No info about conversion event**s** sent to ad platforms means **CPC will likely go up… Unless you **switch to optimizing on platform-focused engagement metrics** like cost per view for YouTube. Then you may actually end up getting better CPC 
  You may need to migrate your budget to publishers** (newsletters, podcasts, blogs) who create great content for your audience (but this is great actually)

Also after reading this article and talking to Dawid who runs our paid program, we concluded that the team at Sentry really knows their stuff. 
But the main takeaway for me is this:
**Doing cookieless (performance) marketing will be scary, painful, and a lot of work at the begining.*But it is definitely doable.*And ultimately may end up being better for both the end-user and marketers as we’ll be pushed to align on user incentives.**
Also, [I shared it on HackerNews ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38965509&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=50-cookieless-marketing-developer-portal-navbar-and-donation-as-swag)and got 186 comments from the devs: 
  * There are a ton of technicalities around how cookies work and how to disable them
  * The reported sentiment around ads (and blocking them), user tracking, and privacy is as strong as ever 
  * Some devs hate Google Tag Manager too (and don’t seem to know what folks use it for)

This comment made me chuckle. HN crowd never fails ;)

As _block_dagger_ c pointed out this article was “long and packed with marketing crap”. Technical, detailed, and incredibly insightful marketing crap I may add. 
[So I suggest you go and read the whole thing ->](https://blog.sentry.io/we-removed-advertising-cookies-heres-what-happened/)
### 2. Great developer portal navbar design from Auth0
Navbar is a hugely important conversion lever on the dev-facing website. I saw it move the needle by x times in some cases/conversion events.
**So, what does a good one look like?**
Auth0 did a great job on their developer portal. But the learnings can be applied to your marketing website too.
