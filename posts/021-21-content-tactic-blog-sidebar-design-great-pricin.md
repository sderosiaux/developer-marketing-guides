# Developer marketing insights
### 1. "Current solution based content"

[John Ozuysal ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-ozuysal/)is a B2B content consultant that talks about SEO a lot. 
While his advice is around general B2B this tactic is very applicable to the dev audience. 
It goes like this: 
  * Pick a **"job to be done” (X)** that your product solves (managing configs, monitoring, automating workflows) 
  * Through user research, find out what are the**solutions in current setups (Y)** that people are using to solve it (Github, Kubernetes, Postgres) 
  * Create an article explaining how to solve that problem in a current setup: **"How to do X in Y" Throughout the article mention why doing**"X in Y is suboptimal" Hint at a **better way of solving the problem** with your product 

Since it is the dev audience we are talking about you need to: 
  * make sure to be helpful and actually solve their jtbd without your product 
  * don't be in your face with showcasing your product. 

But other than that this is a great tactic.
