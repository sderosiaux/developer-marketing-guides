# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Learnings from an AMA with a Head of Growth at Supabase
Came across this AMA where [Rory Wilding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rory-wilding-00297a45/), from Supabase, shared some tips for growing an amazing brand. 
You can [read the whole thing here -> ](https://www.producthunt.com/discussions/ama-session-on-product-led-growth-with-rory-head-of-growth-at-supabase)
But here are some of my takeaways: 
  Getting technical founders involved** in marketing is a huge level. Most tech founders don’t want to do that. They want to leave marketing to marketers. This is why those who do get involved have an upper hand. And to[ resonate with devs on Twitter to such an extreme](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/developer-marketing-twitter) you need that insider knowledge. (I also wrote about [how Tailscale gets on Hackernews](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/developer-marketing-hacker-news) because of that).
  Early days focus on feedback, not scaling channels.** They went over GitHub profiles of folks signing up and reached out to as many as possible to gather feedback. They used the approach from “Mom Test” to understand the dev workflow and jobs to be done best. 
  Launch weeks make a difference.** Some of it is pushing the velocity of output with a static deadline. Some of it is company culture and rallying the team around promoting what you built. Some of it is condensing promotion and landing that dev mindshare even if for a few days. 

But the one that we should never forget is this:
“Engineering are heavily involved with all things related to growth. **Without a solid product that solves a need for people it's pretty hard to grow anything.** A lot of this comes back to iterating based on good feedback loops with our community.”
Rory Wilding, Head of Growth at “the meme company that builds databases” 
Also, [Florent Merian ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmerian/)put together an [awesome summary here](https://dev.to/fmerian/how-dev-first-startup-supabase-grew-from-0-to-50k-github-stars-5d4d) (this is how I came across that AMA in the first place, great find Flo!)
