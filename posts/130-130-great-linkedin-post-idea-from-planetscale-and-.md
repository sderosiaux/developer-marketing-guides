## 1. Great LinkedIn Post Idea from PlanetScale

PlanetScale's approach demonstrates effective visual storytelling on LinkedIn. The post features "a short video with interactive visualization showing database performance across locations."

**Key insight:** Breaking away from text-heavy templates works. The strategy combines one core problem with a compelling interactive element that's inherently difficult to recreate—making it valuable content in itself.

**What makes it work:**
- Minimal text, maximum visual impact
- Demonstrates the product's value proposition immediately
- Interactive elements increase engagement
- Resembles Twitter's simplicity rather than typical LinkedIn wall-of-text posts

The creator, Benjamin Dicken, has several similar examples across LinkedIn and X worth studying.

## 2. How to Sell to Developers Without Turning Them Off

A Reddit discussion on this topic surfaced several consensus recommendations:

**Classic advice recurring:**
- Lead with self-serve resources: documentation, quick-start guides, sandboxes, code examples
- Explain functionality in five seconds—prioritize features over vague benefits and capability connections
- Avoid sales pitches in developer communities; instead demonstrate expertise through helpful code responses

**First-hand insights from practitioners:**
- Multiple commenters emphasized authenticity and genuine helpfulness over promotional messaging
- Community participation requires patience and value-first positioning
- Developer audiences detect insincerity immediately

This aligns with established guidance in materials covering developer sales strategy and marketing fundamentals for this audience segment.
