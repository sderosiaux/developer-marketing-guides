# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Pricing and billing teardowns from Schematic
A few weeks back I came across pricing/billing teardowns in the community. This comes from co-founders of [Schematic](https://schematichq.com/), a pricing/billing product. Four folks going at it from different angles: design/CPO, growth/product manager, engineer/CTO, business/CEO. 
I actually spend a few hours going through [teardowns of Linear, Supabase, Vercel, Mintlify, Posthog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niXp14D6DEc&list=PLaAbRmJj8zVozS8oKNZ2h81Qve9NmKCvg&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=102-pricing-and-billing-teardowns-from-and-how-to-book-demos-with-icps-through-linkedin). Whatever they published there ;). I enjoyed it a ton. 
If you are going through some sort of a pricing/packaging exercise, I recommend giving it a look. Even if you don’t, you might get inspired. 
By the way, I really like this style of marketing, especially in this new content era of hyper-relevant content (persona, theme, first-hand experience), where you want to go for depth and uniqueness. 
Here are my takeaways:
**Complexity communicates enterprise readiness (Supabase, Vercel)**  
Displaying detailed feature breakdowns, extensive add-ons, customizations (all linked to docs) conveys enterprise readiness. This signals scalability and readiness for larger users while reassuring smaller folks, self-served or hobbyists, that if the time comes they are good.
**“Pricing as product” (Vercel, Supabase)**  
Playing on the known idea in dev tools, “docs as product” the idea of "pricing as product" to facilitate growth made me think. In many ways obvious, just made me think when they said it. Effective pricing strategies, including free-to-self-serve-to-enterprise transitions, create paths to guide users toward higher-value plans (and growth).
**When to gate pricing calculators (Vercel)**  
Pricing calculators enhance transparency, but if it just shows you would be expensive, you may want to gate them. Cost is only one part of the story, the value they get when replacing/expanding devs/existing processes is the other. Consider gating when you think this should be told during a sales convo.
**FAQs improve conversion (Linear, Supabase)**  
Clear, well-structured FAQs address customer concerns. Duh. But some folks will not have their questions answered. And you cannot include all (long-tail) obstacle handlers in the copy elsewhere. FAQs solve that. Supabase and Linear both utilize FAQs effectively to manage complexity.
**Pricing as an extension of your brand (PostHog, Linear)**  
The pricing page reflects your brand. PostHog effectively uses personality and humor, while Linear emphasizes simplicity and minimalism, each reinforcing their unique product philosophy. Pricing is one of the most visited pages after all. 
**Predictability and transparency as a differentiator (Supabase)**  
If predictable pricing sets you apart, highlight it explicitly. Supabase emphasizes this consistently (pricing page, billing, modals in-app), reducing anxiety around unexpected costs. If this is one of the big things to handle → handle it. 
**Add-ons as expansion levers (Mintlify, Vercel)**  
Strategically placed add-ons (both pricing and in-app/billing) create opportunities for revenue expansion. Vercel emphasizes this clearly, while Mintlify is still working towards automated visibility.
