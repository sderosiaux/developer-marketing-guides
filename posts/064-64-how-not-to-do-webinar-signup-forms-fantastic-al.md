# Developer marketing insights

## 1. How Not to Do Developer Webinar Signup Forms

**The Problem:**
Requiring business emails for webinar access creates friction. Developers often want to learn anonymously or for personal projects, not as representatives of their company.

**Key Issues:**
- Once you have their email, the follow-up begins: emails, LinkedIn requests, weeks of outreach
- Unsubscribing becomes tedious, leading to spam complaints
- You lose potential users who might have tested your product personally and brought it to their team
- The developer's intent—learning something new—gets overshadowed by your lead generation goals

**The Insight:** "They know the next chapter of this story. The one when they get emails and LinkedIn requests."

Respecting user privacy and intent builds trust, even if it means temporary loss of contact information.

## 2. Fantastic All-Text Reddit Ad from Latitude

**Format:** All-text Reddit advertisement for an open-source developer tool

**What Worked:**
- **Clear positioning:** Title immediately states who they are and what the product does
- **Founder credibility:** Technical founder identification increases trustworthiness and engagement likelihood
- **Honest acknowledgment:** Apologizing for advertising reduces combativeness
- **Technical depth:** Using developer terminology demonstrates legitimacy
- **Low-friction entry:** Directing users to GitHub rather than a website landing page
- **Community focus:** Requesting feedback and contributions rather than signups generates comments and visibility

**Result:** 50+ comments and 90+ likes—expert-level Reddit performance for developer products

## 3. MVP of a Dev Tool Website

**Non-Negotiable Core Pages:**
- Homepage
- Documentation (ideally owned by product/technical writing teams)
- Pricing page
- Solid navigation bar (login, signup, contact, GitHub link if open-source)
- About/Company page (builds early-stage trust)

**Critical Success Factor:** These pages must be exceptional. Most developer traffic flows through them; poor execution kills conversions regardless of marketing efforts.

**Phase Two Additions (after core works):**
Case studies, comparison pages, blog, integrations, code examples, video tutorials, live sandboxes, whitepapers, enterprise pages, feature/use-case/persona pages, resource libraries, courses, community pages, developer portals

**Principle:** Prioritize foundational pages before expanding into secondary content.
