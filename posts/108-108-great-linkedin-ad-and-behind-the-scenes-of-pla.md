# Developer marketing insights

## 1. "32 billion reasons" ad from Aikido

I love this ad from Aikido Security as exemplary storytelling. Rather than explaining concepts directly, the ad "points" to a narrative:

- **The story**: Wiz was acquired by Google for $32B, and community sentiment on Reddit expressed concerns about quality post-acquisition
- **The execution**: Screenshot of a Reddit comment combined with the acquisition news, paired with a pun: "32 Billion reasons to check out Aikido"

**Key principle**: "The best stories are not something you write. It is something you tell. You don't say, just point."

Sometimes I think I live for this stuff ;)

## 2. PlanetScale website change behind the scenes

This section covers a detailed thread by Holly Guevara, PlanetScale's VP Marketing, about their website redesign.

### Results Achieved:
- Signups: **103% increase**
- Qualified inbound: **57% increase**
- Pageviews: **101% increase**

### Key Learnings:

**Building for yourself makes things easier**

The team emphasizes that having technical empathy—being or having been a developer yourself—makes it simpler to understand your audience. Guevara states: "We're writing for ourselves, which makes it incredibly easy to know what kind of questions we want answered."

The entire PlanetScale marketing team is technical; designers code, and the CEO previously led engineering teams at GitHub and Facebook.

**Knowing your dev audience**

PlanetScale targets senior engineers who grow into the platform. The redesign reflects this reality: stressed SREs and DBAs want solutions, not marketing fluff. "There is no level of fancy animation or pitch deck that will talk a real company out of their database requirements."

**Measuring through pain-point language**

Rather than relying solely on conversion metrics, PlanetScale tracked mentions of key differentiators (sharding, Vitess, scaling) in contact form submissions. Result: **1718% increase** in mentions of these terms in inbound requests—indicating the messaging genuinely resonated with the target audience.
