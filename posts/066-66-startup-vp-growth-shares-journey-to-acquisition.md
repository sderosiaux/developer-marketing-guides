## 2. Marketing Measurement with Marketing Mix Modeling

**Methodology Overview:**

Marketing mix modeling helps allocate budgets and resources without relying on UTMs or intent data, even for offline channels like billboards.

**DIY Spreadsheet Approach:**
- List all channels/programs with desired granularity
- Collect monthly impression data for 12-24 months
- Select a bottom-funnel conversion event (qualified pipeline created)
- Build linear regression model using impressions as input, conversions as output
- Identify which channels drive incremental improvements

**Important Note**: While assumptions exist (same-period impact), this approach rivals traditional attribution models in practical utility.
