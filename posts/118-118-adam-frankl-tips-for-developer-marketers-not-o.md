# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Adam Frankl’s tips for developer marketers (not just founders)
[On this week’s episode I interviewed Adam Frankl](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2LY2T8dZNm8OuQyWayRCAL?si=b79d5cf24b704bca&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=118-adam-frankl-s-tips-for-developer-marketers-not-just-founders-a-real-life-example-of-how-clear-and-simple-copy-wins) about technical advisory board, creating content, strategy. Always pushing for examples and tips useful for dev tool marketers and not only just founders.
Adam is perhaps the GOAT of dev marketing but definitely the Triceratops who was the first VP marketing at 3 dev tool startups that became unicorns. It was an honor to speak to him. Learned a ton. 
I think I managed to get a few net new insights for me and hopefully for you as well. 
We talked about soooo many things it is crazy. Some concepts we touched on:
  Technical advisory board tweaks for dev marketers** implementing this (including the chief scientist persona, social media marketing)
  * Creating authority and actual **thought leadership content as a non SME** marketer
  Examples of owning the problem** midnshare from Neo4j (graph database newsletter)
  Strategic narrative** framing for dev tools + example from sourcegraph
  Technology discovery loop for devs** (and getting into those loops)
  * Dark matter devs and how to solve it with **targeting “alpha developers”** who in turn speak to other devs
  Free anonymous piece of product** + examples from Neo4j and Sourcegraph
  * Adjusted **value proposition design** framework (pains, gains, jobs to be done, AND changes in the environment)
  * Why**influencer marketing** is the thing to do. Why Adam believes that paid flavor of this doesn’t work. And what you should do instead
  * When **introductory developer content** is actually the play
  Creating research-based content factory** with an example from jFrog and Tailscale
  * And finally, **why Adam’s is even doing this**.

### 2. Clear and simple copy wins, a datapoint
Came across this example this week:

[See on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zhu-amanda_if-youre-doing-over-1m-arr-youll-know-activity-7341118760830869507-CPSc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAAA6PPusBHGh3FZIjVWx49BUzJv6Bq6AODbE)
So they ran two versions:
  1. The easiest way to capture and transcribe meetings
  2. The API for developers to access meeting recordings, transcripts and metadata

The second option clearly says what it does. And it is the one that gets results ( pipeline) for them. 
The first option sounds like what you’d think you should pitch investors. Or something that “even your grandma would understand”. 
But this is not how you capture interest of people who are searching for the solutions to the problem they are trying to solve. 
For those people you will be better off explaining what you actually do. Especially when you are speaking to devs.
