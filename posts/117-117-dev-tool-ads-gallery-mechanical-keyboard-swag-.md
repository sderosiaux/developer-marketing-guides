# Developer marketing insights

## 1. CISOTOPIA Toy Store from Wiz

Wiz created a fake e-commerce experience featuring security-themed products with punny names and playful references. The checkout process reveals the campaign's true nature—items cannot be purchased, but visitors can enter their email for a raffle drawing.

The author admires this approach for its memorability and creativity, noting Wiz consistently executes engaging campaigns that build positive brand perception before audiences fully understand the product offering. The fake storefront concept shows potential for replication across other developer-focused campaigns.

**Key insight:** Creative, humorous experiences generate engagement and word-of-mouth despite (or because of) their non-traditional nature.

## 3. Parabola Mechanical Keyboards Swag Idea

Parabola customized mechanical keyboards by replacing the Enter key with their logo in brand colors. This combines utility (functional keyboards developers actually use) with brand delight through a subtle, purposeful modification.

The approach succeeds because it connects to the product's core function—automation and workflow execution—creating a clever metaphorical link. It's memorable, shareable, and immediately useful rather than purely decorative.

**Key insight:** Effective swag combines genuine usefulness with a branded touch that sparks conversation.
