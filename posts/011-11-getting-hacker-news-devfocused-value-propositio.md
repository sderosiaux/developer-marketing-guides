## 1. How to get on Hacker News front page: Learnings from Tailscale
After seeing another post “Tailscale Funnel” on the first page I said to myself: “ok Tailscale, let’s see what you are up to”. 
And I [wrote down my learnings here.](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/developer-marketing-hacker-news)
Here is a tldr: 
  * Create something that doesn't feel promotional. 
  * Explain benefits through problems. 
  * A framework I see is this “problem -> obvious solution-> why an obvious solution doesn’t work -> product -> how it works”. 
  * Create deep new-information-heavy content. 
  * Satisfy curiosity, explaining how things work, not “how to gain X by using Y” but rather “How to build Y from scratch”. 
  * Write dev-to-dev, conversational, use technical jargon. 
  * Go with to-the-point titles: No “10 secret ways to…” or “gain X by doing Z” but rather “I sell onions online” or “Tailscale Funnel”. 

### 2. Header design from Mux

Mux does a few things beautifully in this header. 
Value proposition: 
  * The "what" is explained right away: "Video API", "live and on-demand experiences" 
  * Super clear on persona "developers" and job to be done "build online video" 

Animated visual that is really good for dev tools: 
  * that have an API/SDK 
  * that have a UI where the results of that API calls go

### 3. Syften
I came across [Syften](https://syften.com/) is a dev-focused social listening tool.It monitors keywords on Twitter, Reddit, HackerNews, Product Hunt and many others. 
You can even monitor some larger slack dev communities. 
### 4. Radiating circles of developer experience

Original concept from swyx and a very valuable mental model for devrels and dev marketers. 
Product -> Docs -> Content -> Community 
The further you go through the product adoption and market maturity the more "outside" you need to go to deliver value and differentiate.

### 5.Datadog vs New Relic
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/25681735-1894-4a4f-80c0-c55889b07dba/image.png)
Sometimes your product just wins on price. 
I like how New Relic owns it on this page: 
  * They show you price comparison graphs 
  * The CTAs are focused on helping you compare the prices 
  * They use jargon specific to the category to drive the price argument: "peak usage", "overages and penalties", "SKUs"

### 6. Devrel and dev marketing metrics 
Was digging deeper into this last month and found some great resources: 
  * [The Developer Advocate's Guide to Metrics and Reporting](https://theworst.dev/developer-advocates-guide-to-metrics-and-reporting)
  * [Devrel KPIs](https://devrel-kpis.com/%20) from Orbit: quotes from the web on how people measure devrel 
  * (Must read) [Measuring Developer Relations](https://www.swyx.io/measuring-devrel)

### 7. How Stripe go-to-market changed over time
It wasn't always an enterprise go-to solution for payment APIs. 
So how Stripe changed their go-to-market over the years? 
And more importantly, how it all started with a hyper-focus on a startup developer persona?

### 8. Big prize swag campaign
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/56603ee9-4b10-433f-a4ed-1813b95d0049/image.png)
Is it better to do one big prize or many small prizes? 
This is a decision you have to make when thinking about running a swag campaign. 
Turns out that a small number of huge prizes can get you way better ROI on the same budget. 
And NannyML has done it brilliantly here. 
They are a monitoring tool and they give away monitoring setup. 
This is something that actually can go viral. And it did.
