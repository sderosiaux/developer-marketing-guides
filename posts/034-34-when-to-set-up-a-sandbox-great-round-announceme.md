# Developer marketing insights
### 1. When should you set up a sandbox?

I like what [Joel Hans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-hans) said here.
Many dev tools are or want to be PLG. They want to let people play with the product ASAP. 
**But for some products, sending people straight to the app is not the solution to reach THE “aha” moment.** Especially for those that rely on connecting real data, infrastructure components etc. 
You can get them to experience some value, AN “aha” moment. But not the real “I see the other side aha moment”.
You want them to feel what it will be like when they go through procurement, deployment on their infra, setup, and populating the dashboards. You want to skip weeks or months of internal work.
**In those situations, sending devs to a sandbox can be a great option.** Let them experience value on dummy but realistic data. Let them play around but don’t expect them to go through mountains of work to feel it. 
Now, I believe the product tours can also be super helpful. Plus you can do them on top of the sandbox. But if I had to pick one I’d go with a sandbox.
