# Developer marketing insights
### **1. Learnings on open-source monetization from Kelsey Hightower**
[Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=28-monetizing-open-source-dev-t-shirt-idea-and-an-awesome-linkedin-post-format) is the devrel legend. And in this video, he shared his learnings on monetizing open-source projects (among other stuff). 
Here is what I got from it.
**Packaging tips: Putting **GUI and login box (via open directory) is not a packaging strategy **What is a priceable pain:** what features do people need AND are willing to pay for? 
  * Put things that the **community users find boring and Enterprise customers find valuable**. That Cobol integration may just be the thing. 
  * When looking, **devs need a solution right now.** Talk to sales is the only CTA >and they are out.
  * Puttin **plugins ecosystem in the Enterprise is bad**. nginx did it and people hated it. You want people to extend and make your platform more useful. 
  Monetizing based on professional services is great but small.** Nothing wrong with building a small high-margin business. It is just really hard to scale and doesn’t really work in VC-backed companies.

### 2. "Did X and all I got is this lousy t-shirt"
This is a solid swag copy template that resonates with devs.
"I did X and all I got was this lousy Y"
