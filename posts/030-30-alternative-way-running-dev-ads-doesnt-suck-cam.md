[Oleksii Klochai ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oklochai/)is running a dev content agency and recently posted an interesting finding from their work. 
When companies are running paid ads the classic approach is to link to a dedicated landing page. 
They started advising companies to link out to their best dev content created by the devrel team. 
By doing that they managed to:
  * CPC lower by 20-50%+
  * more sign-ups and conversions to paid
  * happier devrels who write that content
  * better internal alignment

Interesting. Actually, [I wrote about some other options ](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/paid-advertising-developer-marketing)like linking to the docs when running remarketing ads. 
Yeah, the takeaway is to experiment with different options cause, especially with devs, there is no one-size-fits-all all approach.
