# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Waste 50% of your budget to get more value from other 50%: ROI of (developer) marketing
Came across this quote from [Rand Fishkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randfishkin/), the founder of Moz (OG SEO tool) and [SparkToro](https://sparktoro.com/) (Really cool audience research tool).

Not many people get B2B marketing like he does. 
And if he is fine with “wasting” half of your budget on things you can’t prove to do 100% of things you believe in having the most impact perhaps you should be too. 
But you do want to:
  * optimize impact within activities.
  * justify the budget for the activity or program
  * make an argument for spending 2x or 10x on something. 

Or your CEO comes and asks you the all-dreaded question of “What is the marketing ROI of this or that?”. 
**So how do you prove that ROI?**
Recently I got asked this a few times and figured I’d finally [organize my thoughts in an article.](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/how-to-prove-roi-of-developer-marketing)
Here is a tldr:
  * You treat marketing programs (or campaigns) like a “product”. And you measure ROI at a program level.
  * You optimize activities within the programs but don’t report ROI on activites. 
  * You estimate the lower bound of program-level ROI based on meaningful outputs of that “product” like signups/demos/high-intent pageviews (pricing, terms of service, contact us etc)

I go deeper into all of these in the article. Super curious to learn what you think about it/how you approach it.
