[James Hawkins](https://twitter.com/james406) is CEO of PostHog and he shares great tips around product management. 
But in this thread, he shared learnings from creating the ideal customer profile (ICP) for their dev tool startup.
Here is my tldr, but read the thread for sure:
  * Having a clear ICP makes other product/marketing decisions simpler (pricing, positioning, branding, roadmap)
  * Create a list of attributes of your ICPs: needs, haves/have-nots. Be really specific.
  * Score your customers against those attributes and identify your ICPs and anti-ICPs
  * Onboard first “reference customers” that fit ICP. Listen to them carefully. Optimize pricing/positioning/branding/roadmap for them. 
  * Tweak/repeat until you get to ~$1M ARR from your ICP

### 2. How to write “Us vs Competitor” articles
This is one of my favorite dev tool vs competitor blog posts.
With these pages, you want to explain when you are better.
But you don't want to berate your competitor.
**And above all, you want to help people make a decision.**
Chances are (almost 100% ;)) that you are not better for every use case. And your developer audience knows it.
But there should be use cases, tool stacks, or situations when you are the best option.
Talk about those. Dev to dev.
[Convex did a great job in this post](https://stack.convex.dev/convex-vs-firebase) that I think can be a template for how to write these:
