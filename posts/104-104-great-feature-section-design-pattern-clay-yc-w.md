# Developer marketing insights

## 1. Compact, Scrolling Feature Sections from Graphite

This design pattern solves the problem of displaying multiple features without making pages feel exhaustingly long.

**How it works:**
- A single section switches subsections as users scroll
- Progress bar indicates what's happening and tracks advancement
- Each subsection contains: headline, one-liner description, CTA, and visual element
- Graphite showcases five features using this approach

**Variants that work well:**
- Removing the one-liner or "Learn more" button
- Auto-progressing sections if users don't interact

**Benefits:**
- Display numerous capabilities without overwhelming visitors
- Makes sites feel shorter and less fatiguing to navigate
- Interactive elements help direct attention to section headers

## 2. Clay + YC Workflow for Booking Meetings

A case study showing how one devtool startup achieved strong results through targeted YC founder outreach.

**The playbook:**
- **Scrape YC Startups**: Use Clay and YC directory to build targeted lists (670 startups, 1,150 contacts in this example)
- **Enrich data**: Normalize names, find emails, gather LinkedIn URLs via Clay
- **Offer free usage**: Frame the value clearly with explicit CTAs
- **Automate sequencing**: Use tools like La Growth Machine to manage follow-ups
- **Results**: 77% open rates, 50 sandbox trials, 25+ meetings, 10 deals closed

**Sample email structure:**
Opens with relevant batch year mention, references company knowledge, explains specific problem solved, includes dual CTAs (try product or book call).

## 3. Learnings from "Marketing to DevOps" Webinar

Powered by Search, a traditional SaaS agency, analyzed dev product marketing effectiveness.

**Key takeaways:**
- **Comparison pages**: Developers search competitively more than typical buyers; clear comparisons capture high-intent traffic
- **Architecture diagrams**: Including these in docs increases visibility in Slack and dark social channels
- **Docs need CTAs**: Knowledge bases attract non-users; contextual signup prompts drive conversions
- **Retargeting works**: While gated content underperforms, targeted ads maintain top-of-mind awareness
- **Tailor messaging**: Different stakeholders respond to different value propositions (developers want power, ops want reliability, leadership wants safety)
- **Ungated content wins**: Developers dislike friction; consider ungating resources
- **Repurpose sales conversations**: Convert effective calls into self-serve content
