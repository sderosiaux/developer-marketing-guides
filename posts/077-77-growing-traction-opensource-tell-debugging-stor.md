# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Tips for growing traction in open-source with Zeno Rocha founder of Resend

  When launching** , spend 1 week on the library and 3 weeks on the website, and the GitHub Readme. Nail the information flow, the readme sections, how easy it is to get started, how to ask for help, what code to copy-paste, 
  Solve for this job to be done:** “As a developer, I want to get it up and running now. What can I copy-paste and get started as quickly as possible” 
  Goal to keep in mind:** you want devs to say “I get the use case, I get how to inject it to my project, and scale as the project/usage grows”
  “Master plan”:** he shared a very re-usable game plan: "Launch open-source project around email, establish ourselves as experts around email, launch a SaaS around email” 
  Vision vs positioning/messaging** : your vision is so much bigger than the first step you communicate to the dev community. For Resend, it started with only devs + only transactional emails. Over time, it extended to also marketing emails. And the vision is so much bigger than this.

###  2. **How to tell a** debugging**story from GitLab**
One of the best types of developer content is a debugging story.
"What is X" or "How to solve Y" work in some situations, especially when you focus on SEO distribution. But a good **debugging story** is something that even senior devs want to read.
This is an **[old article from GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/01/23/how-a-fix-in-go-19-sped-up-our-gitaly-service-by-30x/)** and is **such a good example of that format:**
