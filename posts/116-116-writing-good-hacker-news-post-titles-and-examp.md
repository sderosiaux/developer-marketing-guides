## 1. Hacker News Post Titles: The Power of Understatement

The key to success on Hacker News isn't flashy marketing language—it's restraint. Three similar posts about academic papers performed drastically differently:

- "Your Paper Is an Ad" (2 upvotes)
- "How to Get Your Paper Accepted" (3 upvotes)
- "Getting a paper accepted" (219 upvotes)

The winning title succeeds because it feels like a genuine story rather than a marketer's pitch. On HN, "titles set the tone," and understated approaches that build curiosity outperform authoritative, action-oriented framing. User karma had no correlation with performance—the title itself drove engagement.

**Key lesson:** When posting to HN, avoid pushy language. Instead, embrace subtle storytelling that appeals to the community's appetite for authentic narratives.

## 2. Engineering as Marketing: Building Free Tools for Growth

With AI tools now accessible to marketers, the "engineering as marketing" channel deserves renewed attention. This traction strategy involves creating genuinely useful free tools that drive awareness and conversions.

**Real-world examples:**

- **ElevenLabs** built simple speech-to-text tools targeting specific keywords ("speech to text Polish"), ranking organically and funneling users toward paid products
- **Auth0** created JWT debuggers that became resources developers relied on
- **Algolia** built HN search, becoming indispensable infrastructure
- **Snyk Advisor** drives SEO growth through product-led tactics

The traditional barrier—needing engineering resources—has collapsed. AI-powered platforms (Lovable, Replit, v0) now enable marketers to build tools independently. "Marketers should explore this channel WAY more heavily."
