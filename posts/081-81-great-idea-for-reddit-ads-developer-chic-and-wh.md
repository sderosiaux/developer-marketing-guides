# Developer marketing insights
### 1. When you talk to devs, what should you ask?
Many folks, me included are huge proponents of talking to your users. Talking to devs. But say you do get them on a call. What exactly do you ask? 
I really liked the following post:

[Jon Itkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonitkin/), talks about positioning/messaging for early-stage startups. 
And this post he shared good questions for figuring out your product positioning:
  * What kicked off the buying cycle?
  * What led you to look for a new solution?
  * What option came to mind?
  * What were you looking for?
  * What set our product apart?
  * What changed after using it?

Ask these, follow up with “why is that”, “tell me more” and you are golden.

###  2. **Promoted full-article post on Reddit by WarpStream**
What if you not only posted entire articles on Reddit but also promoted them?
This is what **[WarpStream](https://www.warpstream.com/)** did and I like it.
