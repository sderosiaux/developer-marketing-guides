# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Building developer communities of craft + I am launching a podcast ;)
Ok so it is official. My podcast is now live. Called it “**Going deepear into dev marketing”** . Couldn’t help myself with the name.
[ Going Deepear Into Dev Marketing We go deep into developer marketing. Actionable insights that dev tool founders and marketers can use to grow today. Long interviews with top dev tool marketers, solo deep-dives, examples and teardowns.  open.spotify.com/show/0wyxDG8BkClv5XltUiZdbD?si=c8bb6151e7ab40c7 ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a50a8b4661f7901a602355803) ](https://open.spotify.com/show/0wyxDG8BkClv5XltUiZdbD?si=c8bb6151e7ab40c7&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=109-building-dev-communities-positioning-through-anchoring-and-i-am-starting-a-podcast)
Three episodes already uploaded, a few more ready. Sooo many people I want to talk to and things I want to share in this format. Let’s see how it goes. 
Here are my takeaways from the first episode on **“Building developer communities of craft with Demetrios Brinkmann”: **Get to know people:** when people join just talk to them, get to know them, do a 15-minute chat to learn what they want to get from the community, what their expertise is, where they can chip in etc. 
  Tag and introduce members:** Figure out who knows about what and then @ tag them in the conversations to engage. On top of that intro/connect people who you think could benefit from connecting in DMs. 
  Seeding conversations** : ask people you spoke to, to ask questions in channels. Sharing good articles could help show the community is not dead but doesn’t really grow engagement. 
  Don’t let questions get unanswered** : ask people in DMs to answer, tag people etc. Or try and share resources you saw on the subject so as not to leave people hanging
  Share targeted resources** : when you get to know members, either manually, or through surveys, share super targetted resources with them. Courses, blogs, podcasts, etc when you have things that are exactly what they want. 
  Build community members up**. You see a blog post from someone from community, share it in the slack yourself and start the discussion. Then you can invite them to meetups/conferences, talks, podcast. Whatever social capital you have to give. 
  Gating community** : making sure that folks who get into the community will add/get value from it. Discussions are shaped by the people who are in it so if you have vendors/beginners those are the conversations you’ll see. 
  Seeding community:** you can start by inviting selected people through LinkedIn/Twitter. I liked the outreach message: _“Hey I’ve spent the last 40 days locked in my house [COVID], and wanted to do something productive with my life. And I started this community. If you want to join, let me know”_
  Creating a podcast opens doors** : high-influence people take calls with you when it is a podcast when they may not have talked to you otherwise
  Be-shameless channel:** for some practitioners, it is one of the most valuable channels. It keeps people in the loop on what is happening in the space. And vendor articles or webinars are actually appreciated by some people as the vendors spend 24/7 working with practitioners in the space on their little piece. Plus if there is no be-shameless you will get spam in intro or general. 
  Managing sponsors is tricky:** at a certain scale, you want to get sponsors to be able to fund the infrastructure and people to keep it vibrant. But you don’t want to sell your soul to vendors and sell your members as leads to them. 
  Community of craft vs small exclusive meetups** : you need to live this, this is a huge effort, with content, engagement, etc. It may be smarter to build small exclusive and targeted in-person meetups. Quality over quantity. 20-30 people, not recorded, super focused conversations. And the CTA after that meetup is to join the community Slack. 

**Follow, rate, leave a review.** Of course, any feedback good or bad is always very much welcome:

### 2. Positioning through anchoring and an awesome newsletter. 
Was scrolling LinkedIn the other day, minding my business and what do I see but a new dev marketing newsletter. [DevPMM newsletter ](https://devpmm.substack.com/)by [Marek Nalikowski ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marek-nalikowski_finally-launching-my-substack-devpmm-activity-7320849328858640384-7kqt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA6PPusBHGh3FZIjVWx49BUzJv6Bq6AODbE)(dev PMM at Oxla).

[See on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marek-nalikowski_finally-launching-my-substack-devpmm-activity-7320849328858640384-7kqt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA6PPusBHGh3FZIjVWx49BUzJv6Bq6AODbE)
In the first issue he talks about [“](https://devpmm.substack.com/p/developer-product-positioning-and-messaging-examples-that-slap)**[Developer product positioning and messaging examples that slap”.](https://devpmm.substack.com/p/developer-product-positioning-and-messaging-examples-that-slap)**
His devy explanation of positioning/messaging is just so cool. Will steal it and us it with eng founder for sure. Here it goes. 
  Product = Core logic / backend **Positioning = API **Messaging = Component library **Copy = UI / frontend**

One idea that Marek goes into that I don’t see used enough is **anchoring**. You anchor on something your audience knows. Now classic example of “open-source Firebase alternative” from Supabase is one. 
But there are other flavors of anchoring. 
Funny enough just last week I talked to a marketer from one of the startups I advise about my personal framing for what they do just to see if I get it. Something along the lines of _“If X and Y had a baby, that focused on Z, and had a developer experience of R”_. So yeah I did anchoring positioning for myself. 
Ok, I digressed. The example that made me want to share this with you is this beauty from [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/). 
[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/dd1d1b8d-36a7-4e01-b0ad-ce5babb08bf1/image.png)](https://www.tinybird.co/)
[Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/)
I am talking about this quote that anchors on three popular tools: ClickHouse, Supabase, and Postgres. This one sentence carries so much meaning to people who know them. Good luck landing that message in less words. 
**This is the tricky part though**. You need to know your audience enough to know what concepts are commonly (enough) known by them to use it. So the non-dev audience will likely not get it at all. But this is ok. [You should land messaging for the champion. ](https://www.markepear.dev/blog/who-to-address-on-the-dev-tool-homepage)
And Marek argues that **this is how devs naturally think and talk about products**. 
Cannot agree more. I often ask dev founders “so what does the product do” (having read the website)? How do you explain it to dev friends? How do you explain it to other devs on a meetup or conference? Anchoring is surprisingly common in the way they explain it and very rare in their messaging.
