## 1. Make login our problem. Not yours.
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f9560501-643a-4a00-ad55-5133652cb4ed/image.png)
This is a beautiful messaging of Auth0 solution. 
**Login** Simple explanation of what it does/gives you. 
Simplified of course. 
**Our problem. Not yours.** You "outsource" this boring but important problem to someone else. 
It also has a feel of SaaS in there. They will take care of it. ‍

### 2. "Make DevOps cry in 5 words or less
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a5fa4d7b-d1fe-4c4f-8c0a-10e17273b34b/image.png)
Great Linkedin (or Twitter) post format. 
This is one of those cool self-selecting mechanism as well. 
You attract devs who identify with your ideal developer persona. 
Who get their problems. 
Love it. 
### 3. Linkedin ad format from Algolia
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/4d59f80c-e94c-4b39-9346-960c98eb46ec/image.png)
Great Ad creative that most B2B companies could test.Connects: 
  Trust** : G2 review and links to G2, not their site 
  Value/Benefit** : Clearly explained benefits of using the tool 
  Voice of Customer:** it is explained in the way the users talk 

Great stuff. 
### 4. Cypress CTA
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1fff4a89-7523-430c-b676-4f9c88afabf6/image.png)
You go straight for the install/download. 
I don't know if you can go more developer-focused than that. 
It sets the tone for the entire homepage. 
And let's be honest (almost) nobody actually clicks that "Sign up" button in the hero section. That is a dev-focused CTA. 
[See Cypress.io homepage](https://www.cypress.io/)
### 5. Aporia post format
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7598247a-f76e-4d86-9341-b5460c6c8dbf/image.png)
Nice post format. 
I like it for dev tools that have both API and UI components. 
You show code and what it produces in one view.You can add additional things to the vis part of it for more context. 
### 6. ClearML reddit ad format
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/82d08ba6-d4c5-4c4c-92a8-6a50b5039133/image.png)
Code-style ad format on Reddit. 
Code can speak louder than words (sometimes). 
It makes your value prop real and concrete to the right audience. 
### 7. 140 developer newsletters you can sponsor
List of developer-focused newsletters. It involves: 
  * Description/audience of the newsletter 
  * Audience size 
  * Sponsorship packages if available 

[Check the list in notion](https://bitreach.notion.site/Developer-Newsletters-1320315a0f314e76b2016b39359cb560)
### 8. How to market to developers — according to a CTO
tldr: 
  * Understand what you are talking about or you will lose me 
  * Solve my current burning problems and I will buy 
  * I will ask my friend CTOs Senior Engineers anyway 

[Listen to the episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2F7kxv8CWTNfbIirQU7d5C?si=c24fe36b2aab4b38&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5-auth0-campaign-linkedin-ad-and-post-formats-and-a-great-explainer-video)
### 9. Streamlit explainer
Streamlit has an amazing explainer. 
They show how to go from: 
  * Writing your first line of code 
  * To creating data dashboard 
  * To deploying it across the web 

In 42 seconds. 
No audio, just code and a simplified result window. 
Amazing stuff.[See video on their homepage ](https://streamlit.io/)

### 10. VS page format 
Vs pages are a classic SaaS marketing. 
But I like how Ably adjusts them to the developer audience: 
  * For each criterion, they **say why it matters They**link to their resources** to extend further why Ably works great there 
  * They **use a lot of developer jargon** to make it feel like a dev wrote it for devs 
  * They go over a lot of different categories to make this comparison **deep enough to be valuable** for the buyer 

[See the Ably vs Pusher page](https://ably.com/compare/ably-vs-pusher)

## 1 Pear Fact 🍐
Probably the rarest pear is the [Plymouth pear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_cordata). 
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/18089891-0b48-4524-b3af-c3aa622f1ab4/image.png)
You can find it in the city of Plymouth in Devon, UK (hence the name). But also in Spain, France, and Portugal. 
Ok, that is it for now,
