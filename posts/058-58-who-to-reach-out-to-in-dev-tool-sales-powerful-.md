# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Who to reach out to in product-led sales motion?

[Ben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theproductledgeek/) is a PLG motion advisor specializing in dev tools. We are working with him over at Neptune, he is great. Highly recommend subscribing to [his newsletter](https://www.plg.news/) too. 
Anyhow, this point made lots of things clear for me. Paraphrasing Ben’s post, in PLG you want to:
  * Identify the account that is engaged in the product beyond a certain activity threshold
  * Identify if that account is your ideal customer profile (company size, tech stack, geo, roles, funding round)
  * Find the buyer persona in that account’s signed-up users, through SDRs, ads etc
  Only then reach out to the buyer persona, not the developer end-user**

It may be that for you the buyer persona is a senior developer end-user as well. That is great. 
But if not, don’t burn your communication channels trying to get dev to “hop on a quick call”. It almost never works.

### 2. Vercel NEXT.js conference registration CTA
**How to promote your important company event?**
How about right there in the header?
A typical approach to promoting events on your site is to have them in the Hello bar (right above the navbar). This is a solid option of course.
But what if this is a super duper important event that you really want to push?
**Put it in the header.**
The header is the most viewed part of the most visited page on your site.
Doesn't get much better than that.
But you don't want to distract people from your value propositions and main CTAs too much.
How do you do that?
This is how [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) did with last year's NEXT.js conf.
