# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Product launch loved on HN (+ a new devmar newsletter) 
[Francesca Krihely](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krihely/) (Senior Director of DevEx at Snyk, ex-Director of Growth Marketing at Mongo) has started a newsletter. Yasss! 
It is called [DevFirst](https://devfirst.substack.com/) and I just read all the issues. 
In the latest one, she breaks down fly.io Hacker News launch description which HN devs absolutely loved. 
“fly.io is really a way to run Docker images on servers in different cities and a global router to connect users to the nearest available instance. 
We convert your Docker image into a root filesystem, boot tiny VMs using an Amazon project called Firecracker, and then proxy connections to it. 
As your app gets more traffic, we add VMs in the most popular locations.”
- Hacker News thread from fly.io 
This is such a dev-to-dev copy that I'll just share it instead of explaining it whenever someone asks me for it;) 
No one is "streamlining" or "building better software faster". 
They explain: 
  * What you do? "a way to run Docker images..." 
  * How you do it? "convert your Docker image into..." 
  * How are you different? "As your app gets more traffic..." 

And devs loved it, this is how they would explain the product to their friends.
