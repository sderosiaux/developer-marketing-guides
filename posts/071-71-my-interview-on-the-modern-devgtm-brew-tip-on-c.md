# Developer marketing insights
### 1. My interview for The Modern DevGTM Brew

Had a ton of fun chatting with Achintya from [Reo.Dev](http://reo.dev) for [“The Modern DevGTM Brew podcast”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmmQs_NH--4&list=PLuAYZndyHBxahvnVX4C6_EZZDrxc8Zr82&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=71-my-interview-on-the-modern-devgtm-brew-tip-on-content-distribution-and-a-pattern-breaking-pre-roll-ad). 
We talked about guiding **principles for creating good dev tool websites** for companies going bottom-up developer-focused. What should go there, who you should focus on, what to prioritize.

Btw the lineup for the podcast is fantastic. I can’t wait to listen to other episodes. Subscribed already. 
### 2. Re-use the content that worked before
So two weeks ago I posted this on LinkedIn and got almost 200 likes, 20+ comments etc. That is a great post for me. But it is not what is important.

It is also one of the fantastic [examples of dev tool billboards](https://www.markepear.com/examples/billboards) but that is not why I wanted to share it either. 
What is interesting is that **it was the 3rd time I posted it and it got the most engagement ever**. 
I originally posted it about a year ago and got 50 likes, then reused it 6 months later with similar results. And this time it got around 4x that. 
**So the learning is this. If a piece of content: worked for you before
  * your audience got value from it
  * you know it is still relevant today
  * reuse it, tweak it to make it up to date but use it again

It is better to re-share something valuable than post a half-baked new idea that you don’t even think is that great. And chances are your audience just hasn’t seen the previous iterations anyway. 
###  3. **Pattern-breaking pre-roll ad from Sentry**
Pre-roll ads are obviously invasive and annoying, especially to devs. But they are also prime real estate in the ad ecosystem.
You can choose not to do them at all (fair option). Or try and make them more fun and less annoying ;)
**I like how Sentry handled it in**[**this 16-second video:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDCzzfH3z4Y&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=71-my-interview-on-the-modern-devgtm-brew-tip-on-content-distribution-and-a-pattern-breaking-pre-roll-ad)
