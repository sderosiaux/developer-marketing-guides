[Itamar Ben Yair ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itamar-ben-yair-053271174/)is a dev marketing consultant specializing in dev acquisition through ads and other paid campaigns like influencer marketing.
In his recent LinkedIn post series, he started going over how various dev tool campaigns do influencer marketing. 
[This example from Bright Data ](https://youtu.be/DJnH0jR8y5Q?si=UrX00cYPjz9L5KQP&t=145&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=47-dev-influencer-marketing-great-ad-of-an-infra-product-and-a-tiny-copy-change-that-crushed-it)was great IMHO:
  * They have very valuable and useful but “boring” products: scrapers and proxy networks
  * You want to reach the audience who is not looking for a solution, to grow awareness and demand in the market
  * And you know that unless someone needs scrapers or proxy networks they will not watch a 20min tutorial about it

What did they do?
**They advertised through product placements: They figure out what are the bigger problems where their product solves a “boring” but crucial piece
  * They find dev influencers who create video tutorials
  * They sponsor video tutorials showing the solution to a bigger problem
  * And they are featured when the influencer gets to the point of the video where the problem they solve arises

I like how this is aligned with the video viewer, dev influencer, and company goals. Win-win-win.

### 2. Run.ai Linkedin ad
Attractive ad creative for an infra product that runs in a terminal?
Hard, but Run.ai did that.
