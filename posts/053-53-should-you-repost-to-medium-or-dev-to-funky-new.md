Saw it come up multiple times in our community, I know it from my own experience, you probably thought about it too.
**It’s a common question/problem in dev tools.** Goes like this:
“We have a blog on our site. Should we repost to dev.to/hackernoon/medium etc with a canonical pointing to our site?”
So Oleksii and his team **tried it for multiple customers and… saw no impact: No increase in traffic to the website
  * No engagement on posts

And reposting articles on all of those sites costs time. Not a ton of it but enough to be seen. 
I can only add +1 to it from my own experiments. 
So yeah, seems like we should just spend our time elsewhere and don’t feel bad about it ;)
