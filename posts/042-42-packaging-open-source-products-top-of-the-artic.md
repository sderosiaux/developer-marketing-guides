[Emily Omier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilyomier/) is helping open-source startups with the business side of things. Recently came across her podcast [”The business of open-source”](https://www.emilyomier.com/podcast). Good stuff. 
In [this particular episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5BdCJYYUVpgbxFePsXvHCx?si=35716bab9b3b4115&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=42-packaging-open-source-products-top-of-the-article-cta-and-a-good-way-to-present-integrations), she talked with passbolt founders about their experience pricing/packaging open-source. 
tldr:
  * First, they **built a community** for their open-source product. 
  * At some point **subgroup of the community started reaching out** and asking if there was a commercial version coming. 
  * They **talked to them** to really understand why and what they would want to pay for. They asked them: “Why not just use the community version?”
  * They learned that the **community edition** was great for single-user productivity and collaboration within a single team. 
  * But **bigger organizations need scalability, compliance, SSO.** And that the persona that needs this the most is admin. They sell to them.
  * They also warn OS founders**not to commercialize too quickly**. You will have 2 competing products with different roadmaps, metrics etc. And if you are still small this will slow you down by a lot. 
  * And yes, your **open-source edition is a competitor to your commercial product.**

### 2. "Top of the article" CTA on the blog from Eartlhy
Need one more call-to-action idea for your dev tool blog?
How about starting an article with it?
Sounds weird but if done right it can work. Even with devs (or maybe especially with devs).
[Earthly](https://earthly.dev/blog/docker-networking/) did and they are known for great dev-focused content.
