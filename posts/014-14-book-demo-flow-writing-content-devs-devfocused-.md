# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Viral post on how to write content for devs

[Read on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7044688600440954880/)
TLDR is this: 
**Don't make it too accessible not to lose your ideal dev reader.**
If you write so that everyone understands, you signal to more advanced readers that "this article is not for you". 
Compare these two: 
_"Python is a popular programming language created by Guido von Rossum in the 80s"_
_"Your favorite language where static typing was added yesterday and where 80% of unit tests are checking if your code would even compile. That one"._
Which one will not scare a senior Python dev away? 
So while you may lose 90% of "potential" readers, the 10% you care about keeps reading and trusts you a bit more.

### 2. Posthog "book a demo" flow 
Devs have a love/hate relationship with the "Book a demo" call to action. 
Mostly hate though. 
Especially if what they want is: 
  * know what they will be paying for your tool 
  * just see how this thing works 

But there are moments in the buyer journey when devs do want to have that live session: 
  * they tried it, went through the golden path, and have deeper questions 
  * they know they have specific needs and are unsure/couldn't find it in your docs/website. 
  * they want to customize the pricing plan to their needs. 

Then, having a live session/demo is the fastest way to move forward. 
Posthog handles this very nicely. 
They start with the (anti) CTA.

[See this example in full screen](https://www.developermarkepear.com/developer-marketing-examples/posthog-do-not-talk-to-us)
So they basically: 
  * say "don't talk to us" 
  * give you transparent pricing on the website 
  * give you a recorded demo on the website 
  * let you try the product for free without talking to them 
  * But if you want to talk to sales/support you can reach out 

They continue telling the same story on the [book a demo page](https://posthog.com/book-a-demo):

[See this example in full screen](https://www.developermarkepear.com/developer-marketing-examples/posthog-recorded-demo-page)
They give devs: 
  * recorded, ungated product demo -> if you want a generic demo just watch it 
  * free plan and transparent pricing -> just get started (don't sit through the demo to ask for price) 
  * if you want a custom demo or just talk to a human -> just schedule a call 

Great developer experience.
