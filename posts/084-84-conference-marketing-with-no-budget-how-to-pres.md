# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Why how you present your tool makes all the difference

This is a great post, from a founder of [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/) where he shares learnings from their naming history: 
  * They started by calling themselves a language for web devs: that was scary, feels like a huge change of workflow
  * They tried to make it clear by showing what this language connects with their stack. That is less scary but still
  * They switch from saying language to framework and their numbers shot up. 

Some devs would say “just words”. But words, especially product category or market framing, carry expectations, fears, pains, and hopes. 
And so naming things with “language”, “framework”, “platform”, “tool”, “suite”, “solution”, “app”, “extension” etc makes a huge difference.
Think about the expectations that those words carry and choose wisely.

### 2. How to do conference marketing with no budget
[Robin ](http://Robin%20Moffatt)shared this story of his former colleague turned dev tool startup founder in our community and I loved it:
[“How I marketed to 2,000 prospects for ~$0”](https://michaeldrogalis.substack.com/p/how-i-marketed-to-2000-prospects)
My takeaways:
  * If you don’t have $ to splash think how you can **approach it differently**. Anyhow, being incrementally better is worse than being dramatically different. What can you do that others just cannot? 
  * Become a **walking billboard**. A simple t-shirt with a value prop and a QR code.

  * Create an **awesome customized demo for booths from other vendors**. Who wouldn’t want that? He reached out to all vendors asking and 8/25 replied, 4 ended up doing it. The (obvious) catch is that demos used his product in there. Nice!
  * Reach out to speakers and ask if, you guessed it, you can build an awesome **customized demo for them to present during the talk**. Confluent ended up agreeing to that!
