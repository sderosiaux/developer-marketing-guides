## 2. Developer Marketing Channels (Finding Your Mix)

Rather than listing channels exhaustively, the piece emphasizes strategic channel selection through three key questions:

- **Where does your ideal developer spend time online?** Identify specific channels, podcasts, blogs, newsletters, and accounts they follow
- **How do developers stay current in their field?** Understanding information habits guides channel choice
- **Are developers actively searching for solutions?** Determine if demand exists now versus later

**The recommendation:** Directly ask developers about preferred channels whenever possible, then follow up to understand what resonates about them.
