# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Attribution, incrementality and decision making
In episode 2 of [Going deepear into dev marketing](https://open.spotify.com/show/0wyxDG8BkClv5XltUiZdbD?si=28b92fa0324449dd&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=110-how-to-do-social-listening-my-take-on-attribution-and-terminal-shop-stunts-on-react-miami) I talk attribution. Solo. To myself, like any marketing pro should about attribution. The only way. 
Here is a TLDR + some extra comments. 
**Why do you even want to track/attribute: **Justify the spend** (keep the leadership happy).
  Decide what to 2×, 5×, or kill** (keep yourself happy).

If the data doesn’t change a budget or a tactic, throw it out.
**It should help make decisions. Good enough > perfect: Treat attribution as **directional** , never absolute. Look for insights that drive your decisions. Not clear-cut answers that make decisions for you.
  * Strive for **incrementality** (did this program made impact). Giving a flyer to people entering your store doesn’t move the needle but attributes perfectly. 

**A simple early-stage “playbook”: **Run one big swing at a time.** Spend enough that success looks like a 3-10× bump in core metrics. You’ll _see_ it without fancy dashboards.
  Self-reported attribution** (open text “How’d you hear about us?”) + a quick AI classifier = instant channel buckets. Ignore the 40 % gibberish; the rest is gold.
  UTMs only for debugging.** They’re nice, not mandatory, IMHO. For example, no one clicks your billboard ad, (almost) no one clicks “visit‐our-site” in a YouTube description. But you should see it in self-reported, branded search, and MMM… 

**When you “grow up” to multiple working channels: Layer in a **bare-bones Marketing Mix Model** : weekly impressions per channel vs. weekly demo requests / activated sign-ups / opportunities. Even a spreadsheet regression tells you which lever moves faster.
  2 Years x 10 Channels = 104 weeks** or ~100 data points—enough for a basic regression analysis.
  * The **coefficients are your channel impact** weights; that’s the directional insight you are looking for. MMM tools sell you.

To be clear, Marketing Mix Modeling tools like [Paramark](https://paramark.com/) or [Recast](https://getrecast.com/) go into all the modeling details that you will skip. So at some point you either want someone who understands the details to model your MMM or to buy the tool. Btw for the hackers out there this is an [open-source MMM tool Robyn](https://facebookexperimental.github.io/Robyn/) to tinker with.

### 2. Terminal Shop stunts on React Miami
On the [latest Code to Market podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3I8rDE5dTzBG4IIayUhWJF?si=d33e1580bc6247b2&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=110-how-to-do-social-listening-my-take-on-attribution-and-terminal-shop-stunts-on-react-miami) (which you really should subscribed to btw) Gonto and Hank talk about some great marketing happening around React Miami.
Something I loved was folks from [terminal.shop](http://terminal.shop). They did stunt after stunt after stunt creating such a shareable, fun content and so much brand awareness this is crazy. 
And those are what, 3-4 guys doing fun stuff, recording it raw, and talking about it. And I am sure they are growing their dev products as a side effect. 
Ok, so the first thing I saw was this **Terminal Feud** (like Family Feud for devs ;)). So good.

Than **low-production interviews** but still giving you the MTV-vibe of inside the cool-kids club feel. And this time there was even some professional branding involved.

And then they **recorded a rap song** together with other devs and obviously a video of them recording it.

And you know what they sell? Coffee over a terminal. Which is such a stunt in and of itself.

I just love so much about this. 
With marketing a side project like this you can do anything and it flies. They do things so differently, so B2C influencer style it is just memorable and fun. 
**AND I am sure it grows their core dev businesses as a side effect**. I presume this is at least somewhat calculated but the beauty of how they do those things is that it feels so “not growing business” you can never really tell. Amazing stuff. 
+yes the fact that they are already well-known in the community doesn’t hurt the play for sure ;)
