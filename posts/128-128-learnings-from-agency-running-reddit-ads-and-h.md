Nice real-life learnings on the formats that are working from Ali who is running Reddit ads for their customers:
  * Memes → yep, also talked about it a bunch of times, [for example in the issue #120 ](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/120-teardown-of-linkedin-ads-from-aikido-meme-ads-success-story-and-why-both-devex-and-llmex-matter)
  * “Is this an ad?” text posts → yep, also shared this [amazing example from Latitude](https://www.markepear.dev/example/great-all-text-reddit-ad-from-latitude)
  * Incentive-first copy → have to say, this one I never tried. Basically a “free credits”, “early access” type of thing. Clear offer. 

Wanted to share this because Ali also added a link to [his Reddit ads inspiration library](https://ads.reddit.com/account/airsgf9zg/ad-inspiration) (which is awesome, and I didn’t know you can share inspiration libarries on Reddit 😉 ). My favorite ads from his are (also, you may want to check out [my Reddit examples gallery](https://www.markepear.dev/examples/reddit)):

### 2. How to give a good talk? HN thread
Saw this the other day and figured I’d share just in case you were working on a talk for a conference. 
[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/34fff94f-ee02-4a3f-bb85-4712dd4aa316/image.png)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45076992&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=128-learnings-from-agency-running-reddit-ads-and-how-to-give-a-good-talk)
[See on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45076992&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=128-learnings-from-agency-running-reddit-ads-and-how-to-give-a-good-talk)
Paraphrased takeaways from the article and discussions:
**1) Lead with the win, fast.** Pitch the value prop in the first 60 seconds. Map some flavor of “efficiency, correctness, expressivity” to your product’s speed, reliability, and DX.
Good talks inform, educate, and entertain.
[**Michael Greenberg, Article Author**](https://blog.sigplan.org/2025/03/31/how-to-give-a-good-talk/)
**2) Title = promise.** Your talk title should read like the audience’s desired outcome (“Ship preview envs in 7 minutes”), not a table of contents.
Your talk title should be the agenda.
[**ehutch79 (HN thread)**](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45116982&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=128-learnings-from-agency-running-reddit-ads-and-how-to-give-a-good-talk)
**3). Bio is important but should be quick.** One slide, less than 1 minute. You’re not the keynote (most of the time) your problem/solution/story is.
Keep intros to 1 slide, 1 minute.
**[ehutch79 (HN thread)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45116982&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=128-learnings-from-agency-running-reddit-ads-and-how-to-give-a-good-talk)*4)Teach one portable thing.** Give attendees a snippet/checklist they can use tomorrow (CLI one-liner, GitHub Action, example repo).
Listeners expect party favors; make insights portable.
[**Michael Greenberg, Article Author**](https://blog.sigplan.org/2025/03/31/how-to-give-a-good-talk/)
**5) Slides aren’t the talk.** Don’t go for walls of text unless you want to communicate “overwhelm”. Use one diagram or a few words. Then link to the deep-dive as a blog/whitepaper at the end.
Minimal slides; put details in a complementary blog/whitepaper.

**6) Rehearse where it’s cheap.** Record yourself, iterate, and practice at meetups/Toastmasters — not on a $1k-ticket stage.
Record yourself; use Toastmasters; don’t practice at conferences.

**7) Entertain, but ship content first.** Humor/story beats work; don’t let them replace the takeaway. If you want a north star for “serious fun,” study James Mickens.
Mickens: clear, funny, unforgettable (talk: [Why Do Keynote Speakers Keep Suggesting That Improving Secuirty Is Possible?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGX7odA87k&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=128-learnings-from-agency-running-reddit-ads-and-how-to-give-a-good-talk))
**8)Spice it up with real energy.** Rants can work when they serve the story. But only if the audience still leaves with a tactic they can use.
Fork Yeah! (Illumos history), infamous rant around 33:00. (talk: [Fork Yeah! The Rise and Development of illumos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&t=1981s&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=128-learnings-from-agency-running-reddit-ads-and-how-to-give-a-good-talk))
