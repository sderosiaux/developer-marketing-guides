Here they are:
  #1: “Developer Security”:** Category creation is hard. 
  #2: “Developer Loved, Security Trusted”** : Brand anchors demand.
  #3: Website as a Product:** Treat your website like a product. 
  #4: Big Events > than just Leads:** Go big or stay home. 
  #5: Global + Regional Field Marketing = > GTM Alignment**: Utilize field marketing as the connective tissue to the GTM team. 
  #6: Analyst Relations** : Invest in a partnership with R&D.

### 2. Case study format from LaunchDarkly
Looking for a good dev-focused case study format?
People tell you to follow a classic:
  * Hero >
  * Problem >
  * Solution >
  * Results

They tell you to show numbers, talk value, etc.
And it is true. Great format.
**But packaging this for devs is hard.**
For example, putting numbers in there, and framing it in a "save 28min every week" is a recipe for losing trust with that dev reader.
That is if you can even get those numbers from your customers.
**I like how LaunchDarkly solves it.**
