## 1. Learn social media from Supabase Twitter
Supabase has 28k followers and 100+ engagements on their tweets. On a regular Tuesday. 
I don't know if there is any company account that does that well. 
I wanted to learn how and so I went through 4 months of their Twitter feed. 
TLDR of what I learned: 
  * they understand their audience and craft memes and jokes for that audience 
  * they talk in dev jargon 
  * they make sure their tweets pop in the feed (even if it's the enterprise plan promotion)

### 2. Awesome tweet thread format. Hook + validation + here is more
Saw this tweet recently and loved the flow of it: 
  * Hook me with a story. To the point. Developer speak. 
  * Validate with the middle part. Showing that there will be value. 
  * Push to the next tweet.

### 3. Diagrams "smell" off value. And people share them. 
Saw this workflow/tools tack diagram the other day.Couldn't understand what is so great about it as it is hard to read, low quality etc. But so many people shared/liked it. Why?

It smells like value. 
People want to feel smart and helpful to their tribe and so they share it. 
My bet is less than 2% of people follow this diagram to understand if it is right. 
They share it though, cause it feels like something their network will like. 
### 4. .. 10. Ask your users for insights (gotcha) 
I am a big believer in asking users for feedback. 
_"But most devs will not respond"_
Sure, but some will and the things they will say will be worth it. 
It's one of the most powerful marketing tactics out there. 
Especially early when all your A/B tests are far from stat significance. 
For example, right now, I am thinking about where to take this newsletter. 
Would you want me to: 
  * do 10 insights, or just 3, or 1 
  * go super deep on 1 or just give you 10 quick tips and links 
  * do it weekly, biweekly or monthly 
  * talk more about strategy, tactics, or just examples 

Or more generally: 
  * What would you like to read about on the blog and in the newsletter? 
  * What format of the newsletter do you like the most? 
  * Where do you consume work-related content online (somewhat actively)? 

Answer one of those questions and I will love you forever. 
Answer all of them and I owe you big time. 
## 1 Pear Fact
The heaviest pear ever weighed almost 3kg and came from Japan. It was an [Atago pear.](https://growingfruit.org/t/atago-pear/35206/2) Wanna grow it?Probably easier than a dev tool startup anyway :) 
Ok, that is it for now,
