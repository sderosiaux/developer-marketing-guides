# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Enterprise Founder Toolkit from boldstart.vc
Came across this awesome [resource from an early-stage fund boldstart.vc](https://boldstart.vc/devtoolkit/):

Some takeaways:
_“… if I knew we were competing against an internal tool, I’d ask the teams we were talking to for a demo. More often than not they were happy to do this._
_I asked them what they liked most about it and what they liked least. I’d find out who the maintainers were and talk to them to understand whether this was a project they felt invested in, or if it was starting to feel more like a burden.”_
[Competing against internally developed tools](https://boldstart.vc/devtoolkit/%f0%9f%a5%8a-competing-against-internally-developed-tools/)
_“… we tried a another approach that still had benefits of NPS, but also addressed the drawbacks. The method we adopted is a combination of feedback scoring and gap analysis._
_…_
_We compiled a list of statements and sent them to users, asking them to rank their level of agreement on a scale of 1–5. The linear scale for the responses is 5 because 10 feels far too broad. 5 gives a good range of responses from strong-medium approval/disapproval, to being agnostic (3).”_
[An alternative to NPS for dev tools](https://boldstart.vc/resources/an-alternative-to-nps-for-dev-tools/)
_“Last year,_[_Snyk ran a customer value study_](https://snyk.io/blog/2022-snyk-customer-value-study-highlights-the-impact-of-developer-first-security/?utm_campaign=snyk-customer&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin-organic&utm_content=2022-snyk-customer-value-study-highlights-the-impact-of-developer-first-security) _to understand their customers’ perception of value. Snyk’s user is different to its buyer, and while its users can directly see for themselves the value of using the tool, the buyer (in this case the CISO and CTO), needs more convincing._
_Snyk identified the top CISO and CTO considerations when buying security tooling as risk reduction, coverage, speed, ease of use, developer efficiency, and reliability.”_

### 2. Great Reddit post and comment from Convex devrel
When you promote your feature/product launch on Reddit, it can easily end up being "not well received" to put it mildly.
I am talking downvotes, negative comments that get upvoted and break the discussion. Or good old crickets.
But Reddit can also be a fantastic source of audience feedback, peer validation for your product, and some of the most vocal advocates you'll ever find.
I really liked how **[Tom Redman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-redman-eng/)** from **[Convex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/convex-dev/)** directed the discussion in the Reddit thread under their launch post:
