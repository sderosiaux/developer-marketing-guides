# Developer marketing insights

I am at NeurIPS, the biggest AI research conference of the year so figured I'd share some cool ideas I saw.

## 1. Guerilla Marketing Ideas for Conferences

Two companies went for really cool "in front of the venue" stunts that gathered a ton of attention for what I presume was not crazy amounts of $.

**SKIM.AI** operated coffee stands offering complimentary beverages to attendees who scanned their badges. The campaign featured thematic drink names tied to AI/ML concepts, such as "Restricted Boltzmann Machine" for decaf options.

**Shadeform** deployed a truck featuring digital banner displays positioned outside the venue, creating high visibility for their brand.

**Key insight:** Pre-venue activations capture attendees before they enter, generating buzz and social media mentions without requiring expensive booth space.

## 2. Games and Riddles at Booths

Interactive challenges proved highly effective:

**Jane Street** dominated this category with approximately 4-5 strategically placed riddles throughout their booth, encouraging competitive problem-solving that aligned with their audience's strengths.

**Recogni** balanced simplicity with difficulty through a game directly connected to their product (bits/precision computing). This approach educated visitors while entertaining them.

**Jump Trading** implemented a hyper-competitive rapid calculation game, reinforcing their quantitative trading identity.

**Key insight:** Problem-solvers respond enthusiastically to intellectual challenges that reflect company values and product capabilities.

## 3. Raffles and Giveaways

Prize strategies varied in appeal:

Technical prizes included GPU credits, AMD resources, and cloud computing access. However, novelty items generated stronger excitement—Lego sets, Lambda's branded snowboard, and a robot transformer (particularly resonant at an AI conference) outperformed commodity giveaways in engagement.

**Key insight:** Memorable physical prizes create better word-of-mouth than predictable technical resources.

## 4. Branded Creative Executions

**Databricks** incorporated actual branded bricks into booth design—a literal interpretation of their name that demonstrated wit and attention to detail.

**Recogni** served premium matcha lattes with branded cups, combining quality hospitality with marketing touchpoints.
