## 1. Learnings from DigitalOcean content strategy
I went deep into research mode to understand how DigitalOcean does their magic.Here is a tldr: 
  * They create “give-first” content for their target customers. In their case, how-to tutorials that target long-tail keywords about software development and sysadmin stuff. 
  * Every article has a smell of value all over it. Answers the search query very well. Feels more like docs than a blog. 
  * They focus on accumulating what they call “developer love” with every tutorial, and every interaction. 
  * They make it very easy for developers to “binge read” their blog with navigation to other tutorials and tutorial series. 
  * CTAs are very gentle, and non-invasive. They “wait” for you to be ready to convert. 
  * They re-target with ads to get devs to read more content. 
  * When developers finally are in-market to buy, thanks to the accumulated “developer love” they click on those light CTAs expecting a similarly great experience to what they had so far. 
  * They scale this with a writers' program, content acquisition, and media production teams. 
  * They optimize the design for a great reading experience but make sure you know there is a commercial product behind this blog. They do that by having a product-heavy sticky navbar and banner-like sidebar CTA.

Newsjacking is a great marketing tactic. 
Especially when you can connect it nicely to your product. 
And [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/), a tool for secrets management does it beautifully here. 
They ran a story on how Toyota suffered from a data breach. 
Because they didn't manage their GitHub secrets properly. 
Brilliant.

Adam DuVander and the team at EveryDeveloper did some awesome research on homepages of developer focused companies. 
They also shared a gallery of the above-the-folds. 
Worth checking.

### 6. Console.dev blog
They have a bunch of [really good articles written by practitioners](https://blog.console.dev/) about developer marketing. 
I really liked this one where they go over [dev-focused homepage design principles](https://blog.console.dev/home-page-best-practises-for-dev-tools/). 
### 7. Jono Bacon
He is an ex community manager at Github and Canonical and he talks about community building and developer marketing. 
Recently, he has created two excellent, report-commentary-style videos about devmar: 
  * [How developers stay up to date in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00dOSfrc_Hw&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=9-digitalocean-content-strategy-events-and-dev-focused-homepages)

This is not developer audience specific but very relevant as a lot of what you write are those how-to guides anyway.
