# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Developer marketing examples gallery
Many of you know about my examples gallery. But some don’t. Or don’t realize how much value is in there.

So, for the past two years, I’ve been screenshotting examples of how companies that are good at dev marketing do things like pricing, landing page design, ads, videos, blog conversion ideas. And for each example, I added a note as to why I thought it was good.
Now, it is ~200 examples organized by tags so you can browse all or get stuff for a particular topic. I share links to these depending on the problem we are solving with almost every advising client I have. And folks seem to love it.

###  2. **Developer marketing at Auth0 with Gonto**
[Gonto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgonto/) doesn’t need much introduction. But the show, [Developer Marketing Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIK1OxygEMc&list=PLwOuygPowJYYIJkf9hgPn6wE_uWYCnKp0&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=90-developer-marketing-examples-gallery-and-learnings-on-developer-marketing-at-auth0-from-gonto) by [Adam DuVander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duvander/) and [Mathew Revell ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewrevell/)is a new thing. Do check it out it seems to have a focus/angle on marketers with no dev background getting into dev marketing. 
My takeaways from this one:
  The first two hires were at dev tool startups: Devrel and Growth Marketer**. Both individual contributors. Devrels can emphasize with the dev persona, understand the problem, create content that resonates. But they often miss the frameworks, business connection, metrics thinking. 
  Say “Don’t use our product” sometimes.** They’d have devs at conferences ask whether they should implement Auth0 authentication in some basic scenarios. They would say no. If you only want to do that use X, Y, and Z. No need to use our product. If you need more advanced things like A, B, C maybe try it out. That builds trust. A good rule of thumb (for me) is to think whether you’d recommend your product if you weren’t part of the company. 
  Diversify your community/framework bets.** When choosing in which communities (typically around frameworks) to invest your time/$ pick two. An established, big and small but up-and-coming. It is easier to be seen in the up-and-coming one and if it blows up you blow up with it. Figuring which up-and-coming to bet on is tricky. Being plugged into your audience and ecosystem is key. But at the end of the day, you are making bets.
  How to convince your boss templates.** Give your developer champions a template they can use to message their bosses. Often they need to do the selling internally but you can and should help them do that. One example is giving them a Slack message they can almost copy-paste that has links to resources and the message focused on that buyer/influencer persona (non-user). You can create prompts to create/adjust those Slack messages to different situations. 
  Layer decision-maker LinkedIn ads**. So you see those dev champions activate and give strong signals of getting value from the product. And you send out the “how to convince your boss templates”. You can run LinkedIn ads to decision maker person within those accounts (Eng manager, CTO, VP eng, Director of Eng). The purpose of this is not to “convert” them but to build mental availability and trust for when they join the discussion they heard good things about you.
