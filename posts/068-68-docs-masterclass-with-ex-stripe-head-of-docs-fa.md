Some time ago, when I shared my learnings from looking into [Digitial Ocean content strategy](https://www.markepear.com/blog/developer-content-marketing) and tagged some leaders from DO, someone reached out to me saying something like:
“Hey, I like the content, but you do know that the person who really made a difference there was Etel Sverdlow, right?” 
And so when I saw [Etel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/etels/) start a newsletter I got really excited. 
So [Etel’s Substack](https://etels.substack.com/) has just posts right now and they are bomb:
  * [”We need to start marketing… Now what?”](https://etels.substack.com/p/coming-soon): Talks about dev marketing channels (YouTube, Events, Written, LinkedIn, Discord, Email) and gives tips and stories for each 
  * [“What I wish I knew about PR that I know now”](https://etels.substack.com/p/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-pr-that): Goes into why even do PR in dev tools, how to pick and work with agencies and outlets, and how to craft the story PR folks may pick up

I highly recommend checking it out. And I am excited for the future issues. 
### 2. How to create great docs with ex-Stripe Head of Docs Dave Nunez
Had a chance to co-host an [MLOps community podcast](https://podcast.mlops.community/) episode with [Dave Nunez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djnunez/) who ran docs at the GOAT of all docs Stripe.

Here are my top takeaways: 
  The first impression matters a ton** : Show diagrams, show code, and make it inviting. Whitespace signals that the docs will be approachable and easy to scan.
  * The most **impactful user research** is to get a dev to complete a scenario and ask them to do things as they normally would and “think out loud”. That uncovers so much. 
  * If you cannot just **ask your company devs** to take a look at that doc and ask them “what are your takeaways”. See if they align with the goal of the doc
  Create escape hatches**. People will land on the wrong pages. For example, when you google Stripe checkout you can end up on the dev-focused or no-code-focused page. Put a link/button at the top to help people go to the page they actually wanted. 
  Docs MVP.** Don’t think of any other docs before you nail the first quickstart experience where a dev understands what the product is, and accomplishes something in one 15-30min sitting. 
  * Later, **align your docs with dev stages** : getting started, design, build, deploy, manage. It will make it easier for devs to achieve more. 
  How to measure docs** : customer satisfaction on doc pages 60%+ is good and a north star of time to do X like time to first API call, or time to first dashboard created. 
  Look at search results.** It uncovers the language devs use and the features they want. Update your search internals to that. Also many folks search in google for “X {BRAND}” or “X {BRAND} docs” so you can treat those searches similarly.
