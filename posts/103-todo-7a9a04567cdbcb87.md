# Developer marketing insights
### 1. CTOs delegate research → optimize for the dev champion evaluator
A few months back, I wrote an article [**Who to address on the dev tool homepage?**](https://www.markepear.com/blog/who-to-address-on-the-dev-tool-homepage)**,** following what I often hear from founders marketing dev tools:**“** _But CTO is the buyer, we should talk to them on the homepage”_
This week I saw some interesting research on this.

[See on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peeplaja_47-of-ctos-either-fully-delegate-vendor-activity-7300122363210166282-0rQE?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA6PPusBHGh3FZIjVWx49BUzJv6Bq6AODbE)
Takeaways on how CTOs evaluate vendors:
  25% fully hand-off** tool evaluation to devs (or other champions). Those are mostly folks at bigger 1000+ people companies. Another **12% delegate functional** evaluation, deal with financial/compliance, etc. 
  22% do initial research** , create a shortlist, **delegate functional** evaluation to devs
  13% fully evaluate themselves**. Mostly folks at 200-500 people companies.

So this means that probably in over 80% of situations you should assume that the developer (or other champion who feels the pain the most and wants the capability) would be doing the functional “does it do what we want” evaluation. 
**That means that you want to optimize your marketing on that champion dev, not the CTO (unless they are your champion)**. This means website, content, ads etc. And then have materials they can use to help CTO drive/delegate the security/ROI/compliance etc.

### 2. Code snippet on Stych website

13% signup form conversion bump with a dev-focused trust/motivation builder.
Dev goes through your page, clicks the signup button, and sees a signup form. Now you want them to actually sign up.
**The V1 approach** is to go clean, a few social signup buttons like GitHub and call it a day.
**The V2** is to add trust/motivation builders on the page:
  Logos** -> big enterprises and hot startups using your product always feel reassuring
  Testimonial** -> fellow dev talking about the product makes your claims real
  Value prop** -> reiterating what the product does, key capabilities, makes what you can deliver clear
  How-to** -> showing how you get to that value with a 1-2-3 steps removes friction, makes it feel easier

Now, [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) went for an interesting V3:
**Code snippet** -> how about just show it? this is a flavour of that 1-2-3 how-to but extra dev-friendly. They also made the code interactive so that you can tinker with it, make it feel yours already.
And they saw a 13% signup conversion bump. Nice!
Definitely an interesting thing to test out.
