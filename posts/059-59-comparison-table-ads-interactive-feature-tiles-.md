# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Comparison table ads

So the idea is simple:
  * Run you vs competitor ads to your audience
  * Choose a few dimensions where you are different
  * Make sure that those dimensions tell your core “why us” story
  * Present it in a simple table creative 

I think in his [article on comparison ads](https://newsletter.itamarby.io/p/talking-about-the-competition-in) Itamar shared that creative:

Simple but effective. **People learn by comparing and contrasting vs what they know**. And this style of ads helps them do that. 
Bonus points if you explicitly say what you are not. It builds credibility and trust and almost nobody does it. 
Otherwise, you risk becoming a [Frog watch vs Rolex meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrideAndPinion/comments/ott5d8/rolex_vs_frog_watch/):

### 2. Interactive feature tiles from Clerk
Sometimes your dev tool has many features/products that you want to show. **How to present many features at once?**
Showing all of them as separate sections doesn't work with more than 3. It just gets too long very quickly. 
**You can go with the tabs pattern** where each tab has copy+visual for a feature. But there is another option that makes a ton of sense when you have many features to show.
**Interactive tiles of different sizes.**
I like the implementation of that pattern coming from [Clerk](https://clerk.com/):
