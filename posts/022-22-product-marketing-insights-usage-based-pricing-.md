# Developer marketing insights
### 1. "People don't care about features!" or do they?

[Anthony Pierri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonypierri/) is a product marketing expert who focuses on early-stage startups. His content (and diagrams) is 🔥. 
TLDR is this:
  * In top-down sales-led motions, you talk to executives. They care about ROI, benefits, and the “WHY”.
  * In bottom-up product-led motions, you (mostly) talk to users. They care about features, differentiation, and the “WHAT”.
  * Now, when talking about features, **focus on those features that differentiate you** , not the ones that everyone has.

### 2. Usage-based pricing with a cap from Appsmith
Usage-based pricing is loved by devs. But has its own problems.
Ok, so first what are those problems?
**Value metric: users don't understand your value metric
  * even when they do, they cannot map it to their usage patterns.

**Predictability and procurement: it is easier to predict the headcount than the usage
  * per user pricing is obvious, everyone across the org understands it

**But devs love usage-based pricing: it is "fair", you pay for what you use
  * you can scale up/down as you need

**It is great for a dev tool company: you align user adoption, the value created, and monetization
  * as org-wide usage so does the invoice

But pulling it off is not as easy as you may think.
**Choosing that value metric, packaging it, and presenting it is a struggle.**
I like what Appsmith chose to do.
