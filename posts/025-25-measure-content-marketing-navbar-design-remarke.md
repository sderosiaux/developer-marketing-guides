# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Measuring content marketing

[Jared Waxman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwaxman/) ran the Auth0 content operation. 
Recently he shared his [content measurement framework in his newsletter](https://hypergrowthpartners.substack.com/p/fire-framework-for-measuring-content-marketing). Do read it, it is brillliant.
This is my long TLDR.
At the end of the day, there is only one metric that could matter for any marketing program. 
**Revenue. Everything else is downstream.**
But downstream is where all work happens and you have to tie downstream (leading) metrics to that upstream (lagging) metrics like pipeline or revenue. 
This is where their FIRE score helps. This is how you set it up.
**Understand why you even measure content: **to track progress:** you want to see that your content program improves over time 
  to optimize activities:** you want to write better articles or run better ads over time
  to allocate resources:** you want to manage your portfolio of activities and scale up/down what works and doesn’t 

**Map out content touchpoints: **stages:** awareness/consideration/conversion
  content themes:** what you talk about (auth in react js, testing Kubernetes configs)
  content types:** how you talk about it (articles, newsletters, videos)
  distribution channels:** (Twitter, blog, Youtube)

Now is the good part imho.
**Assign $ value to each content touchpoint: you cannot connect a Twitter thread to a sale but it doesn’t mean that 1000 likes are worth nothing
  * figure out**how much each touchpoint in each stage is worth perhaps a free signup is worth $100, 1000 Twitter impressions are worth 10$ and one view of a case study is worth 2$
  go back from revenue events** which you know the $ value of, to figure out what those numbers could be
  * those are estimates, adjust them as you get more/new information

**Assign FIRE component to each activity: **Frequency** : number of views to stay top-of-mind
  Impact** : influence your bottom line
  Reach** : to reach as many unique people in your TAM as possible
  Engagement** : to capture attention and drive action

**Assign weights to each FIRE component: this is where you **customize it to your company goals you are creating category you need a lot of reach and frequency
  * you are competing in a crowded market you need more engagement and conversions

**Now you have a single FIRE metric that you can optimize across all content activities.**
BTW they even shared a [spreadsheet with this framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gi6qI05hfOS8firts26S6NxLooirQUXex5KeNE8MFCk/edit). You can slice and dice your results on stages/themes/channels etc to make decisions. And show it in $ for ROI discussion with management.

### 2. Snyk navbar resources tab design
The **"Resources" tab** is the most loved and hated tab for developer marketers.
Ok so the common problem is that you have lots of different resources:
  * docs
  * product videos
  * meetup videos
  * recorded webinars
  * learning center guides
  * blog articles that don't talk about your product
  * and so much more stuff

**You want to showcase them in the navbar but where do you put them?**
Under product? Company? Docs?
How to make sure that people don't go to your blog to read about your product just to find out that you talk about the industry problems there?
Enter the "Resources" tab. The "Miscellaneous" of the navbar world.
And typically it is just crammed with all stuff that doesn't fit anywhere. Just like any respectable misc folder would. 
**How do you deal with that?**
Snyk approached it in a clear and logical way:
