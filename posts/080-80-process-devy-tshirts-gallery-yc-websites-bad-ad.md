[Sefa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mso96/) created this fantastic resource. As it says on the tin:
  * 30 Y Combinator dev tool websites 
  * organized in 19 categories
  * in one Figma file

Take a look!

### 2. My process for t-shirt copy creation
I’ve been working on creating copy for t-shirts we give away at AI/ML conferences. 
Judging from the fact that people wanted to buy them off of one of our sales reps when we ran out of t-shirts suggests that there was interest. 
**My personal favorites:*“I am in it for chains and models” -*50 cent*AI engineer*Attention is all I need*LLM size matters*I don’t work out, I train models*This is my process for coming up with this stuff: Go to the relevant subreddit, find top discussions
  * Go over comments and extract the most common/upvoted concepts, acronyms, jokes, and one-liners
  * Go to ChatGPT and ask it to propose puns including those concepts. Give it as much devy context, and good examples as possible.
  * Find the ones that are close to something good. Many will be very bad, significantly worse than my pear puns ;)
  * Refine them by tweaking things manually, asking ChatGPT to try this and that. 20 more versions etc. 
  * Talk to your team. Some of the best ideas came from combining this process with human-human interactions (thanks Patrycja!)
  * Pick the ones that are closest to your product/benefit/value if possible. This is hard but sometimes doable. 

Enjoy! And if you come up with something good, please share. I’d love to add things to my library ;)
