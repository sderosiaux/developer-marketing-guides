# Developer marketing insights

## 1. Self-Hosted Deployment in Documentation Navigation

n8n strategically places self-hosted deployment guidance in their docs tab dropdown. This approach frontloads a key differentiator where developers naturally look when exploring a product.

**Key insight:** "One navbar tab, devs will click on or at least hover over the docs tab. So putting your self-hosted deployment guide in there will land."

The tactic works because it surfaces important information at the moment of discovery. Additional candidates for this treatment include quickstart guides and integration documentation.

## 2. PostHog's Growth Strategy Lessons

Based on an interview between Ben Williams and PostHog co-founder James Hawkins, several growth principles emerged:

**Word-of-mouth as growth engine:** PostHog identified developer desires—all-in-one tooling, competitive pricing, authentic support, and technical credibility—then doubled down on delivering exactly those things.

**Radical transparency wins trust:** Revealing roadmaps, processes, handbooks, and compensation publicly builds confidence among skeptical engineers who avoid traditional sales conversations.

**Open source as differentiator:** Making code inspectable from day one reduces friction and generates organic community growth. As Hawkins noted: "If a developer can pick software that is also open source, it's just better."

**Internal culture mirrors external perception:** PostHog's "step on toes kindly" philosophy—direct feedback without politics—creates authenticity that resonates with users externally.

**Interactive product demos:** Liveblocks embeds playable feature demonstrations alongside code snippets, letting developers experience functionality directly.

**Strategic open-source sponsorship:** Clerk sponsors messaging within the Auth.js repository, positioning their hosted authentication service as a natural complement to the self-hosted alternative.
