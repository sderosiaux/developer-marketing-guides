# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Getting pear-sonal
The first thing is first. **THANK YOU!** Without your words of support, your comments/replies, your thumbs up (to an occasional “crap” emoji) I would have never made it this far. That I am sure of. Thank you, from the bottom of my pear-shaped heart. 
Never thought I’d actually make it to #100. Knew of a rule of 100 and all the benefits of consistency and all that stuff. But I started this as a side gig while full-time CMO-ing when my kid was about 3 months old. And it was a monthly newsletter at first ;)
Was surprised how much you all liked it. Then I felt pressure to deliver. Then I didn’t want to disappoint you. 
Some of my best stuff was actually great. Sometimes I hoped I had more time to make it great. But then I remembered that I had other obligations and needed to triage. Always kept the bar of “is this helpful to founders and marketers at dev tool startups?”. I hope that every issue has delivered at least that. One helpful thing. 
Fast forward 3 years and I am still doing it as a side gig, still CMO-ing, still pushing my dry af pear puns. And if you let me I’ll continue doing just that for the next 100 issues. I hope you are ready. 
But some things did change. Let’s look at some numbers and stuff.
### 2. Numbers, best of, and content
By all metrics I care about this newsletter is overall a big success to me:
  * 1000+ CMOs, marketing managers, devrels, and founders “wait to open this every week”. Their words, not mine. 500+ of them open this almost every week. 
  * So many amazing folks from so many amazing dev tool companies read it and occasionally write to me. 
  * It consistently gets 65%+ open rate and 10%+ CTR. 

These are no rookie numbers as certain traders in certain canine-referring blockbusters may have put it. 
And if you look at the best by open rate and CTR this is just crazy. 
Best 3 by Open Rate:
  * 69.47% 🍐[ #75: Examples of dev tool sales outreach emails, how to pick your channels, and a new resources for founders](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/75-examples-of-dev-tool-sales-outreach-emails-how-to-pick-your-channels-and-a-new-resources-for-dev)
  * 68.22% 🍐[#81: Great idea for Reddit ads, developer chic, and what should you ask in dev interviews](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/81-great-idea-for-reddit-ads-developer-chic-and-what-should-you-ask-in-dev-interviews)
  * 67.97% 🍐[ #76: How to do developer journey, signal-based sales at Apollo GraphQL, and Polypane website teardown](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/76-how-to-do-developer-journey-signal-based-sales-at-apollog-graphql-and-polypane-website-teardown)

Best 3 by Click Through Rate:
  * 31.16% 🍐[ #41 Big list of dev influencers, devy blog design, and a CTA that will make you chuckle](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/41-big-list-of-dev-influencers-devy-blog-design-and-a-cta-that-will-make-you-chuckle)
  * 28.13% 🍐[ #14: "Book a demo" flow, writing content for devs, and dev-focused GTM playbook](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/14-book-demo-flow-writing-content-devs-devfocused-gtm-playbook)

Maybe more importantly it pushed me to stay in the loop and create/collect stuff consistently:
  * 38 Articles on the [Developer Marketing Blog](https://www.markepear.com/blog)
  * 192 Examples in the [Developer Marketing Examples Gallery](https://www.markepear.com/examples)
  * 590 links/resources organized in the [Developer Marketing Resources Library](https://adaptable-ash-99c.notion.site/Developer-Markepear-resources-library-cbfa02dac52040a3a198499cf9d20937)
  * 153 Episodes in my [Developer Marketing Podcast collection](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/58WTT1mkiaawmNO34fNuBZ?si=d5617bacfd494c6a&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=100-getting-pear-sonal-numbers-and-learnings-from-3-years-of-writing-about-dev-marketing)

It also helped me connect with [25 advising clients](https://www.markepear.com/work-with-me) and 8 sponsors. And drove a solid chunk of the 2100 amazing folks who are engaging in our [marketingto.dev](https://marketingto.dev/) community.
### 3. Learnings
What did I learn from all this?
Obviously, it's hard to really know where my head was at 3 years ago but I can tell you where my head is now. To keep it short, just 3 thoughts. 
#### **You can’t fake real expertise**
When it comes to content I tell people to look at what they created and think. Think of a person from your dev audience, imagine you read it to them out loud. Or you send it to them personally. Do they find it useful? Do they think this is good? Would you feel ashamed sending it? Too often the content doesn’t make that bar. 
The reason is, not the narrative, designs, or topic. It’s the expertise. Or lack of it. Most often, creating something actually useful is too expensive. Takes thinking, sharing first-hand experience, talking to your users/audience. You may not have access to that at your company. 
But this is exactly where the moat is. Look at 3 articles that make it to the first page of HackerNews. Or blogs respected by devs like fly, Tailscale, Charity WTF. There is always expertise, insights, learning, a real story in there. 
Yes, some things can help tell that story: formats, templates, ghostwriters, agencies, AI. But it can only help in delivering that first-hand experience, expertise, or point of view. Ideally all three at the same time. You need that if you want to stand out.
#### **First product/company experience is key to word of mouth**
I saw somewhere that up to 80% of new signups in dev tools can come from word of mouth. Don’t know about 80 but I did see 40. And how do you impact word of mouth? By creating the product devs love to use. A bit more than that actually. 
You want a product that gives you that “omg I love it” experience in the first session. That journey to the first API call, to setup moment at least if not activation should be smooth. From seeing your company on Twitter, googling the name, landing on your homepage, through the first docs experience, peak at the pricing, getting started. Running that first snippet and getting that first win. 
If any of this feels bad the chance of devs telling other devs “omg you got to try this” goes down dramatically. And it is a silent thing. No referral programs, discounts, or awesome brand campaigns will ever beat a product that gives you that pure joy of a first experience. 
One thing I’d add to that is that positioning and messaging (on your homepage and otherwise) play a big role in that too. You want people to recall you when your trigger word comes up in casual dev conversations. And you want to communicate that trigger concept early in the journey. People may never try your product but still share your name if they understand exactly when to use you. Devs want to be helpful, help them be helpful. 
#### **Most of it is “just” good marketing**
One of the things that still makes me angry is seeing folks from devrel, product, or just devs talking about something that “marketing just cannot …” and then go on to explain a classic marketing concept. 
I don’t understand why people feel they can just shit on us marketers, imply more or less explicitly that we are idiots, and think this is ok. All that while basically talking about good marketing principles but pretending it is something else entirely. 
Things like understanding your users/audience, aligning with their preferred way of communicating (test » show » tell), delivering your message in the places where they are, speaking to their actual problems vs pitching the product, packaging/pricing the product in the way devs want to buy (sorry adopt). 4P of marketing right? Product, Price, Place, Promotion. 
I hope 3 years from now things will be different. But idk. In the meantime, let’s just continue doing good marketing folks.
