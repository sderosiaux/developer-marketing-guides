### 2. How to market on Reddit
I went on a bit of a rabbit hole that ended up with me reading through a bunch of resources and discussions, compiling learnings, and adding a few of my favorite examples. Click out to the original resources or jump to my takeaways at the bottom. 
But here is the story. 
Ok, so I saw this post/video by Tim Davidson:

Which led to me reading comments from Tas Bober:

And someone mentioning Maddie Wang:

So I followed that thread:

And found another comment and article on it which I also read through.

Which pushed me to watch the interview with Paul Xue:
And after combining learnings from all of that here are my takeaways:
### Pick your subreddits
  Start** with places like r/devops, r/programming, r/kubernetes, or anything tied to your tool’s stack.
  Use research tools** (GummySearch, HiveSight) or manual keyword searches (“API observability,” “microservices hosting”).

### Do your research
  Sort posts by Top** (last year) to see which threads get traction. Look for patterns—tech reviews, personal ‘war stories,’ rants about pricing, etc.
  Create a swipe file** of headlines and conversation styles. Notice how the community communicates (they can be blunt).

### Set up a legit account
  Use a personal account** at least 6 months old. New accounts arouse suspicion.
  Build some karma** before pushing your product. Comment on general dev topics, post in r/ProgrammerHumor for fun, be authentic.

### Disclose and engage
  Be transparent** : “I’m an engineer/founder building X.” but keep it casual and towards the end of the post
  Answer real questions** : Offer solutions, code snippets, or relevant experiences from your own stack. Go into details, and actually share something net-new.
  Mention competitors** if they fit. Showing honesty wins trust among devs.

### How to comment
  1. **Case studies and war stories Detail how you or a customer cut build times, tackled scaling, or fixed a memory leak.
     * Include specifics (languages, frameworks, metrics).
     * Doing that in a bulleted format works great
  2. **Subtle CTA End posts with: “I’m building a tool that does X—DM me if you’re curious.”
     * Don’t open with a pitch. Redditors hate it.
  3. **Ask for input “Anyone else tried solving this? What worked for you?”
     * Encourage discussion and show you’re there to learn, too.

### Craft high-performing posts
  Try punchy titles** : “we cut docker build times by 70% with these 3 changes.” But more generally use a similar format to what performs in a given Subreddit.
  90:10 rule** : 90% useful tips, <10% mention of your tool.
  Engage quickly** : Reply to comments within hours. Devs expect prompt back-and-forth.

### Mind the moderators
  Read subreddit rules** : Some allow links on certain days or pinned threads only.
  When in doubt, DM a mod** for permission. A quick ask can save you from a ban.

### Get Google/AI SEO through Reddit
  Bottom-of-funnel keywords** often rank via Reddit. “best error monitoring tool for python” might land your post high on Google.
  Optimize titles** : Use those keywords in the post or comment title, but keep them human-friendly.

### Iterate and track
  Measure results** : Use unique links or simply ask new signups, “How did you hear about us?”
  Improve** if you get downvoted. Adjust your tone, or pick a different topic next time.

### Stay consistent
  Post or comment weekly** : Don’t spam; just show up to relevant threads.
  Respond to DMs** : You’ll get private messages → answer them thoroughly. They can turn into real leads.
