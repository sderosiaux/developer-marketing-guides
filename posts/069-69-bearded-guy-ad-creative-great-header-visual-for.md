First off, big thanks to [Itamar Ben Yair ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itamar-ben-yair-053271174/)for sharing so many awesome dev tool ad creatives. So helpful!
What I like about this one is:
  * It feels **different, DYI,** not overproduced. And because of that it catches your attention.
  * It keeps the attention of people who care by actually explaining what the product does. The **“bearded guy” walks you through an example. It is all based on the **materials from their website and docs**. No additional resources were needed to create it. That means no reasons/blockers not to do it. 

Cool idea to test out.

### 2. Great API product header visual from Deepgram
If you have an API product presenting it in an exciting visual way is hard.
But **[Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/)** managed to do just that.
