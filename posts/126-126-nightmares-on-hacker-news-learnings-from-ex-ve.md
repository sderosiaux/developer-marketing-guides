# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Getting on top of HN seems may is a “nightmare” (or is it) 
Just saw this story on top of HN:
[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ef817dbe-a63b-4bae-9e14-0f6de5ce7e0c/image.png)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45099922&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=126-nightmares-on-hacker-news-learnings-from-ex-vercel-vp-marketing-and-a-great-launch-video-ad)
With the first comment being:

And figured I’d share something that seems to me to be a clear pattern for HN. 
**Attaching to a feeling of frustration** gets you upvotes/comments even if people never read the post (this time I think they skimmed through the post). 
While infuriating is probably not the strongest word to use looking at [HN search results](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&query=infuriating&sort=byPopularity&type=story&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=126-nightmares-on-hacker-news-learnings-from-ex-vercel-vp-marketing-and-a-great-launch-video-ad) the are a few strong candidates that hit the feeling. 
**Other candidates that I really like include: “nighmare”, “horror”, “pain”, “wrong”, “bad”.**
Obviously stuffing those words in your blog title to try to get to developer emotions may is not enough for this to work. Ideally you speak to a problem that people actually experienced. 
But **it can move the needle** especially for those people who will only read the title and go to comments (most HN readers? definitely many). 
So while Lago could have written “How to build billing correctly” they went with [“Billing systems are a nightmare for engineers”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31424450&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=126-nightmares-on-hacker-news-learnings-from-ex-vercel-vp-marketing-and-a-great-launch-video-ad) and got 777 upvotes and 359 comments. If you want to hear about that story Ahn Tho, Lago’s founder talks about it on Scaling Dev Tools:
[ Top of Hacker News with Anh-Tho from Lago Scaling DevTools · Episode open.spotify.com/episode/2RmPGUQT4wIu0Td7CVEWue?si=6770ab98431d487f ![](https://image-cdn-fa.spotifycdn.com/image/ab6772ab0000169234b2a3e5f9a6b5be517a2c40) ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2RmPGUQT4wIu0Td7CVEWue?si=6770ab98431d487f&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=126-nightmares-on-hacker-news-learnings-from-ex-vercel-vp-marketing-and-a-great-launch-video-ad)
As I shared some time ago when [going deep into Tailscale Hacker News strategy](https://www.markepear.dev/blog/developer-marketing-hacker-news) creating content where you go deep on the problem sprinkling your product around but not breaking the story with it is the way to go. 
And if you can increase the chance of going to the top of HN by charging it emotionally why not. Also “negative charge + problem” just works so much better than “positive charge + solution”. Especially on HN. 
Below are some results from Algolia HN search -> try and filter mentally to just look dev tools and problems/concepts. Sometimes results get mixed up. 
**Nightmare**
