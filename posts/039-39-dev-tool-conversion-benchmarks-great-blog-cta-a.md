# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Dev tool conversion benchmarks
[Anna Debenham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-debenham/) wrote another great article:
[ “So… what does good look like? Product benchmarks for dev tools in 2023”](https://medium.com/boldstart-ventures/so-what-does-good-look-like-product-benchmarks-for-dev-tools-in-2023-c41884c2b388)
And who doesn’t love benchmarks? I know I do. 
So what does it say? Let me tell you.
**Where do leads come from?**

Organic is only 31% and pretty much on par with sales-generated. What?
I would expect organic to drive way bigger chunk of all leads/signups but perhaps community and other things are just hidden within the 41%. 
Or maybe we are not doing as good of a job driving developer traction as I would have hoped?
**How about sign-up conversion?**
The median is at 10% across the board but as she says:
“The overall distribution in results was high, from 2% for the 25th percentile for free trials, to 20% for the 75th percentile for freemium”
Anna Debenham, Operating partner at boldstart 
And on average it takes devs 3.3 visits before they do sign up. 
And out of those ~10% signups only 23% stay active after 28 days. 
**Conversion to paid?**
5% of users convert to paid within 6 months from signup. 
Which is only half of the rate at which non dev tool products convert. 
**Speaking of revenue, where do new customers come from?**

Interestingly 40% is old good sales-led. 
I’d expect with all product-led sales/growth motions the initial revenue would mostly come from self-served (and then grow through sales). 
Not really. 
But sales-assisted and self-served, which are often closely related sum up to 43% so they are not really behind.
