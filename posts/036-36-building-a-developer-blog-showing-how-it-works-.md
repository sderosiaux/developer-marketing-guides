# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Building a developer blog
Recently sat down with Jonathan from [crowd.dev](http://crowd.dev) to talk about building developer blogs.

Shared some learnings around:
  * reviewing and editing articles 
  * picking good topics 
  * and finding writers 

+ a few other thoughts on marketing to devs. 
I thought it was actually a pretty solid convo ;)

### 2. “How it works” as a timeline from SST
I like this idea of showing how your dev tool works.
With developers, you almost have to explain how it works on your homepage.
Many products do some version of Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Step 3 -> Success.
I really like how SST approached it with a timeline.
