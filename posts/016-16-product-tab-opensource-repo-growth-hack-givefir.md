# Developer marketing insights

## 1. How to design the navbar product tab

The challenge lies in determining what belongs in a navbar and how to structure it. The "Product" tab is particularly tricky, as it can become overloaded with various content types:

- Some teams include documentation and product videos
- Others showcase features, integrations, and code examples
- Some present solutions organized by role or industry
- Some consolidate everything into one section

**PostHog's Approach:**

The company uses "features" as the tab label, which resonates better with developers than alternative terminology. Their strategy includes:

- Displaying the data stack and integration compatibility (addressing a common consideration)
- Featuring customers within the product tab itself, recognizing that developers may skip a separate "customers" section
- Showing customer logos alongside results achieved, providing social proof without requiring navigation
- Using "customer stories" instead of "case studies," which feels more developer-friendly

## 2. Leveraging open-source projects to reach developers

The strategy involves solving problems for maintainers in publicly visible ways.

**Uffizzi's Method (via Josh Thurman):**

- Company offers ephemeral environments as a service
- Created pull requests to open-source projects integrating their product for free
- Maintainers welcomed the contributions, appreciating the value provided
- Users of these OS projects encountered their product organically
- Some developers became interested enough to test it professionally

This creates a win-win-win situation. While labor-intensive, testing with three popular projects in your space can reveal whether the approach gains traction.

## 3. "Give-first content" in developer marketing

Mitch Wainer (former DigitalOcean CMO) discussed this concept. "Give-first content" is company-agnostic material that delivers value to your target audience without expecting return.

**DigitalOcean's Implementation:**

Their version centered on how-to tutorials addressing real developer problems:

- "How To Create a New User and Grant Permissions in MySQL"
- "Java SimpleDateFormat - Java Date Format"
- "How To Use docker exec to Run Commands in a Docker Container"

By creating tutorials developers actively seek, DigitalOcean established itself as a go-to resource for sysadmins. The key consideration: content must serve your actual target audience, or traffic generated proves largely worthless.
