[Kyle Poyar ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-poyar/)is easily in the top 5 people I’d follow if Linkedin banned me for posting pears and I had to start 
In his [recent newsletter](https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/scaling-to-5b-with-cockroach-labs) (another thing I’d follow) he explained why a cloud, consumption-based business model is (usually) better than self-hosted. 
His TLDR is this:
  * If you can just do the cloud service, just do the cloud service.
  * Selling cloud services takes longer than you expect, but the time-to-value for the customer is faster.
  * Ultimately you want to comp reps on consumption just like the customer is paying on consumption.
  * PLG is part of everyone's strategy if you want to be successful, even if you sell to large enterprises.
