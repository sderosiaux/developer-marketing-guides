# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Programmatic SEO from Datree
[Itamar Ben Yair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itamar-ben-yair-053271174/) is an awesome dev marketer who shares his journey on Linkedin and recently started a [Dev Marketer newsletter](https://thedevmarketer.substack.com/). 
In his recent post he shared how inspired by Snyk Advisor they sat down to build a programmatic SEO project for Datree, [Helm Chart DB](https://www.datree.io/helm-chart).
I am not going to go through everything ([his post just explains it really well ](https://thedevmarketer.substack.com/p/generating-10k-sessionsmonth-with)😉 ) but one thing stood out for me. 
Thinking about building it pragmatically, as a startup should. 
A project like that takes a lot of time and you don’t want to invest it blind. Especially when you don’t have a lot of those resources.
**So what they did was create a POC: Just a single page build and filled by hand
  * Google ads pushing traffic to that page

And with that, they could prove the ROI quickly and proceed to build the entire project with confidence.

### 2. Sticky "star us on GitHub" from Posthog
OK, the best way of getting GitHub stars is by creating a project that solves real developer problems really well.
But I assume you have done that already. 
**How do you boost those** ⭐️**even more?**
I mean you got to ask people one way or another.
Many companies put it in their navbars or hello bars.
Posthog adds a sticky banner at the bottom of the page that follows you as you scroll.
