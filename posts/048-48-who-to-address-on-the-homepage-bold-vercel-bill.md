# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Who to address on the dev tool homepage?
Had a flavor of this discussion a few times recently:
_**“But CTO is the buyer, we should talk to them on the homepage”**_
Imho most of the time you shouldn’t. You should speak to the champion. They will speak to the CTO.

[Read the article](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/who-to-address-on-the-dev-tool-homepage)
Here is why:
  Traffic distribution:** The vast majority of the traffic on your dev homepage is not the buyer persona. It is an individual contributor dev who may become your end user. 
  CTOs don’t evaluate themselves:** Most of the time the CTO appoints someone to run a proper evaluation. Typically the very dev who brought the problem/solution to them.
  Homepage is not the medium:** When convicting buyer personas (not end users) to buy, slide decks, ROI-heavy case studies, and sales calls seem to be the way to go. 

This is completely reversed for end-user devs. They visit homepages, they evaluate tools, and they like reading websites (and docs obviously). 
But if you “sell” the product to the end-user dev. If they become your champion. Well, they will sell it to the CTO.
