# Developer marketing insights
### 1. How to make your brand memorable: The Roll from Aikido Security
I am turning into an Aikido Security fanboy but their campaigns and marketing overall is just soo funny, bold, and gets attention. 
Shared a [teardown of their LinkedIn Ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7GujkhG5pg&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=124-how-to-make-your-dev-brand-memorable-and-what-is-still-relevant-from-my-2022-interview-on-scaling-devtools), talked about [OnlyScans in the issue #106](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/todo-a96f5c04b54d2b00), and now I have another treat. The Roll.

Click out and watch that video. 
They took their slogan “No bullshi*t security” and took it to the next level. 
So for the Black Hat conference they came in with a campaign around a branded toiler paper ;)
Quite sure this will be one of the most memorable stunts that happened on that conference. And the best thing you can do for you brand is make it memorable.
