[Martin Gontovnikas (Gonto)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgonto/) is one of the best startup dev marketers I know about. He was VP of marketing at Auth0 from the very beginning till they got their unicorn status. 
Definitely a person to follow. He knows his stuff. 
Anyway, on the [Build by OpenView podcast](https://podcast.openviewpartners.com/public/32/OV-%7C-BUILD-21cbd466/9a2447b9), he shared why they went to conferences early on. 
**It wasn't to get leads or to "build awareness"**. 
This is what they did instead: 
  * They interviewed devs to figure out where they hang out, how they find out new technologies etc. 
  * They realized a lot of their target devs follow certain **influencers** on **Twitter And that a large chunk of them focus on **AngularJS They figured that if they built relationships with AngularJS influencers they may share their content on Twitter 
  * That would obviously be huge as it would build their brand in the authentication space 
  * So they went to every AngularJS conference in the world to **build relationships with AngularJS influencers And later those folks **shared their content** about authentication on Twitter 
  * And so Auth0**blog became a go to place** for all things authentication 

**So they didn't go for the attendees. They went for the speakers.**
Brilliant!
