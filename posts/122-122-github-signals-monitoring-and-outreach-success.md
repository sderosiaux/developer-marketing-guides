# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Effective dev tool messaging and correlation is not causation
Came across this post from [DevPMM newsletter](https://devpmm.substack.com/archive) (by [Marek Nalikowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marek-nalikowski/overlay/about-this-profile/)):
[ How to build effective messaging for developer tools and infra Cut the fluff and only say the things that matter using a lightweight product marketing framework — with examples from Temporal, Neptune, Depot, ngrok, Lago, and Signoz. open.substack.com/pub/devpmm/p/how-to-build-effective-messaging ![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdvj!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F447e3374-9ed9-48e8-9019-e258fd08a256_2880x1440.png) ](https://open.substack.com/pub/devpmm/p/how-to-build-effective-messaging)
One of the key insights is that good messaging is context + differentiation. I love that. Marek shares the latest approach from one of my product marketing heros Anthony Pierri, where he talks about adjusting their approach to [**differentiation first positioning.**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthonypierri_positioning-messaging-canvas-activity-7353454698890194944-epC8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA6PPusBHGh3FZIjVWx49BUzJv6Bq6AODbE)
I think it has to be when you have all those chatGPTs, all those tools and competitors. **One thing that will always remain is differentiation.**
When you double click on it differentiation is why you even exist. If you don’t have a good answer to that question then why did you built it in the first place? 
Also, a **good reason doesn’t necessarily need to be product-focused**. It can be distribution focused. If you are an ex big 7 CTO, have 100k followers and you launch an almost exact copy of existing tools, this will likely be enough to cause trouble. 
Ok, long tangent ;) the article is great, do read it please:
  * Marek went over all devtools mentioned on [Scaling DevTools podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7gBGm04ilDmRJqOxzEjEHi?si=21e92535b99f43cf&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=122-github-signals-monitoring-and-outreach-success-story-effective-dev-tool-messaging-and-correlation-is-not-causation)
  * Chose six that had really clean homepage messaging: Depot, Signoz, ngrok, Lago, Temporal, and Neptune (nice to mentioned, kudos to my awesome PMM [Patrycja Jenkner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrycja-jenkner-7a0279a7/))
  * Went deep on each company’s messaging dissecting into pieces what makes it good

He also touched on something I find crucial. **Correlation is not causation.** Especially when it comes to early-stage messaging.
Ok, so there were many way more successful startups featured on the pod that didn’t make Marek’s list. But their messaging wasn’t very clear and/or served a completely different purpose then you may expect. Their messaging may actually be slowing down their user/customer growth. You never know. 
**In clear terms you shouldn’t apply messaging ideas from mature, successful, established companies to your early stage startup.**
I’ll give you an example. One of my fav dev tool companies Snyk had an incredible focused, clear messaging for years.

Today, just visited their site it says:
[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8d16a428-7cbc-4fff-9321-818cc53b79ec/image.png)](https://snyk.io/)
So it went from clear, explaining exactly what it does, how is it constrained to a slogan that could go on the billboard in SF and anyone can sort of get it. Sort of because the product could be almost anything in the security space ;)
And**it changes because your market changes** from niche, innovators to more mainstream and pragmatic to almost everyone as you are speaking to people from high-level buyers, to potential employees, to public investors on that homepage. 
It is a natural progression but important thing to understand. We talked about it a bit in our [Ultimate Guide to Dev Tool Websites](https://www.plg.news/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-developer-website) together with Ben Williams who ran growth at Snyk for years. 
The main takeaway is, when you are early, don’t learn messaging from successful mature companies. Use [https://web.archive.org/](https://web.archive.org/) and see how they looked when they were “your age”. Learn from that and you’ll be fine ;) 
### 2. Github signals monitoring + outreach success story

[See on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/piyush-agarwal-reo_22-linkedin-response-rate-how-kubegrade-activity-7346179048877826048-FKBt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA6PPusBHGh3FZIjVWx49BUzJv6Bq6AODbE)
This is a great story coming from Kubegrade one of the [Reo.dev](http://Reo.dev) customers. Doesn’t happen often when a case study is worth sharing not for trust building reasons btw so good job Reo. 
Oh, and the you can build this workflow yourself… or you can use one of the signal tools like Reo. 
Ok, so the play is:
  * They tracked activity in their GitHub repo and competitor GitHub repo
  * They qualified high-intent people
  * They enriched it with LinkedIn profile links and emails
  * Reached out on LinkedIn with a following message 

“Hey, I’m building something to simplify K8s cluster upgrades. It’s super early, I’d love your feedback if you’re open to it.”
That gave them 22% response rate, lots of convos and 5 demos. Not too bad.
