# Developer marketing insights
### 1. The Ultimate Guide to Developer Marketing | Lee Robinson (Vercel)
[Lee Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leeerob/), is a legend in developer experience/devrel/dev marketing space. Currently VP product at Vercel. 
In this interview, he shared his thoughts on developer marketing and building great dev tools. 
My takeaways:
  The free tier is key:** try before you buy/adopt is one of the few expectations shared by pretty much any developer group
  * Don’t forget that **developer experience starts (and ends) with your product.** In devtools often devex of the product is the product. API design is your product. 
  Write how real humans (devs) talk.** Test with “Would you/other devs actually say something?”. 
  All docs should have a quick start.** Cut the talk, show me how I get to value now. 
  Developer marketing** is about showing what is possible, what can I build with the tool. Then teach them how to do it. Show demos, then give resources. 
  Hype vs reality** : balance is key. There is a fine line between hyping up your product and what is possible now. The cost of losing trust is real but you want to stay excited about it. 
  Own your mistakes**. When you make a mistake, be clear and precise as to what happened. Share those retro notes it builds transparency and trust. 
  Playbook for building a dev products** : talk to them, listen to feedback, ask follow-up questions, fix what doesn’t work, and tell those devs that it is fixed. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

That got[ Zach Goldie](https://www.zachgoldie.com/) (who helps dev tools with homepage messaging by the way) to share a [tool](https://theirstack.com/en) he recently discovered that monitors public mentions of tools by companies and gives you an API and ready-to-use datasets with that info. Thank you so much, Zach!!!
