# Developer marketing insights

## 1. Prepare for a Hacker News Launch Even If You Never Will

Preparing for an HN launch—regardless of whether you actually launch—provides substantial strategic value. The preparation process compels you to:

- Involve technical founders and developers in messaging
- Articulate your product's core problem and solution
- Explain your company backstory and founder motivation
- Define what makes you distinctly different
- Design a free developer journey that enables trials

This exercise forces you to adopt the perspective of the demanding HN audience, pushing you through the complete experience: from understanding the product description through reading pricing and documentation to testing the offering.

**Materials created during this preparation become reusable assets** for Reddit launches, blog posts explaining problems, battle cards for sales conversations, and comparison content.

## 2. YouTube In-Feed Ads

This underutilized tactic involves promoting your own YouTube content through Google Ads, appearing in search results and recommended video feeds—a more organic discovery method than mid-roll interruptions.

**Key practice:** "If you're working with YouTube influencers, ask them to connect their YouTube channels to your Google Ads account. This way, you could use their data to create audiences."

The approach attracts viewers seeking educational content naturally aligned with your product category.

## 3. Tips on B2B (Enterprise) Pricing

**Enterprise Pricing Foundation:**
- Use "Contact Sales" CTAs with custom pricing based on value delivered
- This matches buyer expectations for enterprise software

**Value Estimation Process:**
- Discuss outcomes with internal champions before finance discussions
- Quantify impact: time savings, revenue increases, or risk reduction
- Example: 20% support query reduction = measurable staffing cost savings

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Set price at 25-50% of demonstrated value
- Match competitor pricing if value estimation proves difficult
- Increase prices by 50% per pitch until losing 25% of deals

**Cost Reality Check:**
If your cost exceeds estimated value, reconsider your approach—pivot toward higher-value offerings rather than competing on price.

**Avoid Common Mistakes:**
- Don't race-to-bottom against competitors; instead add 10x features
- Premium positioning actually strengthens consideration
- Keep pricing simple over complex-but-accurate structures

**Mitigating Usage-Based Risk:**
- Start usage-based pricing with large customers, then offer annual commitment discounts after two months

**Enterprise Sales Terms:**
Skip lengthy free trials; opt for brief POCs with defined success metrics or annual contracts with 30-60 day money-back guarantees instead.
