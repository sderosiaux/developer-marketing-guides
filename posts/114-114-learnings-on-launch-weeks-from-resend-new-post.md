# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Don’t be “for every company and idea on the planet” 
I saw this post the other day and thought it is a good trigger to talk about something I see a lot.

Ok, I know correlation does not imply causation. So much has changed over the last 2 years and there are so many reasons why a startup fails. 
But. 
**I do hear a flavor of “but the vision is sooo much bigger” from founders** or marketers who talk to founders ;)
Look, I get it, **vision is bigger and it should be. But vision is not your (current) positioning.** Especially in dev tools. Don’t put it in places where your target audience comes to understand what you do. 
And with a small team you just cannot go after all different segments, all different integrations/communities, all different adjacent product categories. You just can’t be a “software platform for every company and idea on earth”. 
Early start narrow, build credibility, build one fantastic product that people rave about. Then go wider. 
Once example is [Snyk narrow initial positioning](https://www.markepear.dev/example/snyk-narrow-initial-positioning).
