# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Fun little employee advocacy play
Getting employees to post on LinkedIn is hard. If people don’t want to do it they just… don’t want to do it. 
Over time I went from “let me try and convince you that it is worth it” to “if you want to, I can help”. Power of aligned (or misaligned) incentives rules here. 
But this week I saw a fun little trick.

I mean why not:
  * People have work anniversaries
  * Info about it typically goes on Slack anyway 
  * Why not give people a little nudge in a form of a fun company badge
  * So that they can look fun/cool on LinkedIn

This can work. Incentives are aligned. 
Probably it won’t give you million qualified signups but it can get you some extra awareness. But since it is super “cheap” the ROI of the play is likely there. 
### 2. Newsletter on how to create LinkedIn technical content
Some time ago Paolo’s content popped up in my feed:
[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5dd068f5-f51a-40e0-baa0-c39aef230c13/image.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paoloperrone/)
[See Paolo’s LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paoloperrone/)
And he’s been sending his [newsletter “Tech Audience Accelerator” ](https://techaudienceaccelerator.substack.com/)~twice week. Focused on how to create LinkedIn content as an AI/ML startup founder (also, kudos for actually focused positioning ;) ). 
Just tons of actionable insights in there. The posts fall into 3 buckets:
  * prompts and templates → reusable patterns that work today to make writing easier
  * stories from the trenches → what is working, what is not working
  * essays/guides → thoughts on strategy and why things work the way they work 

Imho this is an absolute must if you are creating on LinkedIn for the tech audience whether you are in AI/ML or not. 
Just look at some of these posts:

### 3. How to sell if your user is not the buyer | Hacker News
There was a really good discussion on it on HN recently:

Here are some notes/tldr but this is a fun read. 
**Classic lead gen gating gets the hate (obviously)**  
Requiring info to download an ebook and chasing devs after they shown little interest turns users into detractors.
“I don't have buying power, but I do have bitching power.”
**spauldo*Don’t go around the gatekeeper**  
Emailing the whole org to bypass an IT owner gets your domain blocked.
  
_“_ Start email blasting others on my team… Quick way to get your domain blocked.” 
**thewebguyd*Quote before demo (for dev-ish buyers)**  
Some buyers (especially senior devs evaluating) want a fast price estimate to move forward with shortlisting for deeper evaluation. Save the pitch for when it helps.
“Don’t make me sit through a demo just to get a quote… just give me the numbers.”
**thewebguyd*But many non-dev buyers like demos**  
At some point many (or most) Enterprise buyers do expect a call to contextualize price and options. Build a bit more trust in the company. 
“Nobody makes $10k+ purchases without talking to somebody.”
**mnhnthrow34*So you can segment by audience (dev/user, buyer)**  
Let developers tr. Let non-dev buyers talk.
  
“Non developer audiences like demos. Developers… like to try things out on their own.” 
**chairmansteve*Don’t gate your docs please**  
Gating API docs blocks evaluation and goodwill.
  
“Requiring people to sign-up… just to view API documentation.”
**Terr_*Have an entry plan with visible pricing**  
Fixed, small-team pricing seeds future enterprise accounts.
You NEED fixed pricing… tie in a customer at the low end.”
**benjiro*Be honest about the long tail**  
Serving many tiny accounts can cost more than it’s worth when compared to a big enterprise deal. 
“Long tail… combined they might be worth less than a single big customer.”
**arccy*Respect devs inbox**  
Spray-and-pray sequences damage brand and relationships.
“Emailing me every 5–15 minutes… probably blessed from the top.”
**neilv*Remember who enjoys the attention**  
Some sales motions exist to flatter people spending other people’s money.
“Flatter people… whose job is to spend other people's money.”
**fijiaarone*Design for the principal–agent gap**  
Your user isn’t the buyer; equip the user to sell internally.
“Make the user your champion.”
**doesnotexist**
