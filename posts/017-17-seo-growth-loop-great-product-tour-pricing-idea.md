# Developer marketing insights
### 1. How to sell to developers (tldr; you don't)

Finally finished writing my article on selling dev tools. 
Wanted to go deeper into the sales side of the dev tools GTM. 
Here are my takeaways: 
  * Think of users (devs) and buyers (team leads, CTOs) as connected but separate entities. 
  * Give users what they need to adopt your product and hopefully share it with other devs. 
  * Talk to them about adoption, solving use cases. 
  * Give your buyers reasons to buy at a team level and organization level (enterprise). Give them economical reasons to buy this for their devs. 
  * Have a free and commercial tier of your product and think carefully about what goes where. 

And above all don’t sell to individual devs, educate and enable them. Sell to their boss.

[Read on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7052552621915529217/)
[Ben Williams ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semanticben/)was a VP of PLG at Snyk and now advises on PLG and shares gem after gem on Linkedin. 
In this post, he talks about [Snyk Advisor.](https://snyk.io/advisor/)
The idea behind this growth loop is simple: 
  * Figure out what problem your audience searches for often: compare OS packages on security 
  * Find the long tail search intent: "{package} security", "{package} vulnerability" 
  * Choose intent that is close to your product but complementary 
  * Create SEO optimized pages programmatically 
  * Add CTAs to your core product 
  * Profit 

They executed it beautifully and it was a huge success.
