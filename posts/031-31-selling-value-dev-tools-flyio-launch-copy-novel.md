[Anna Debenham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-debenham/) is a VC and an ex-Director of product at Snyk. 
Recently I came across her post and an article about [”How to sell the value of dev tools in 2023”](https://medium.com/boldstart-ventures/how-to-sell-the-value-of-dev-tools-in-2023-cd5d3826a358). 
You know how I like “features vs values” discussion. I even [wrote an article about it. ](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/value-proposition-developer-tools-examples)
But Anna is making a great point that in 2023 power dynamics shift away from an individual contributor dev and closer to the budget holder and CFO.
Convincing the IC is not enough as they will be pressed more than ever to explain the need for your dev tool. 
And in her article, Anna goes into how to actually quantify your product’s value. With frameworks and examples. Good stuff.

### 2. fly.io Hacker News launch description
Hacker News developer audience doesn't love promotion to put it mildly.
But some dev tool companies manage to make this audience their biggest ally.
[Fly.io](http://Fly.io) is one of those companies.
And they had a super successful product launch a few years back.
