# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Case study X/Twitter ad from ClickHouse 
You know that I am a big fan of ClickHouse product marketing. Their older header is one of my fav things since sliced bread:
[Example: Clickhouse header design](https://www.markepear.dev/example/clickhouse-header-design)
[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a7bdc15e-1481-446f-b941-a16709431936/image.png)](https://www.markepear.dev/example/clickhouse-header-design)
And their comparison pages/campaigns are great too imho -> talked about them in [How to create a good dev tool comparison page](https://www.markepear.dev/blog/dev-tool-comparison-page).
And this is their ad I saw on Twitter recently:

[See on X](https://x.com/clickhousedb/status/1982826369299120582)
I liked:
  * the Netflix (customer) **visual** but in ClickHouse colors → nice touch but a simple attention grabber
  hook** on Netflix scale with numbers that give a hint that this will be at least somewhat juicy
  promise** of walking you through their (Netflix, the customer) optimizations. Again hinting at some technical areas that will be discussed
  Not a mention of your product.** The entire ad is about their customer, and learning how they do great engineering at scale. Interesting.

Then the case study they link to looks like this:
[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/87ff1004-277f-4ed5-a7d4-a4b04de364c8/image.png)](https://clickhouse.com/blog/netflix-petabyte-scale-logging)
[Read on ClickHouse blog](https://clickhouse.com/blog/netflix-petabyte-scale-logging)
So they start with a **TLDR** that actually frontloads a ton of good info (a concept from [“Writing without bullshit”,](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Without-Bullshit-Career-Saying/dp/0062477153) one of my favorite books). 
Right after that in the **intro** they go into details of the scale plugging gently but proudly that Netflix uses ClickHouse. They also hint at this being written or co-written with Netflix engineers and keep it mostly about Netlfix and their scale of problems. 
And the first **H2 is again curiosity grabbing** “Inside Netflix’s” logging architecture which makes you want to keep going. 
I really like this campaign idea and would be curious to know how it actually performed but looking at the engagement + quality / focus of the content I think it might have.
