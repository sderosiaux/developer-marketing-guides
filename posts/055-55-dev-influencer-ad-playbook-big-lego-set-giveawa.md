This is a simple strategy that can deliver results really quickly. 
Basically, you:
  Borrow*the*trust** (ok buy) of the respected dev in the community. 
  * Get them to **present the product** in a way the influencer thinks would work for their audience (which is often a solid proxy for your audience).
  Distribute** that to your target audience at the largest scale you can afford. 

You can **run that playbook with your tutorials too**. You don’t get the borrowed trust part but you can more control over the product presentation. Has it’s perks too.
