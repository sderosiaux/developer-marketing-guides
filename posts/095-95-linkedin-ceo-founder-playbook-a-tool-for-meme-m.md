# Developer marketing insights
### 1. LinkedIn CEO/Founder playbook
So I wrote a new: [“LinkedIn CEO/Founder playbook”](https://www.markepear.com/blog/linkedin-ceo-founder-playbook)
Here is the intro:
This article is my TLDR based on hours of reading/listening about Founder/CEO LinkedIn content creation mostly from**[Project33](https://www.project33.io/)** (an agency that specializes in this) and their show **[Founder-Led Marketing Show](https://open.spotify.com/show/03CXzsZp7wdqIRVDcqPTFH?si=6101123c25f44807&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=95-linkedin-ceo-founder-playbook-a-tool-for-meme-marketers-and-posthog-s-design-our-billboard-campaign)** where they interview folks who grow through Founder/CEO on LinkedIn. I tried to extract the absolute essence from it. 
Also, I know the reality of trying to do this sort of thing with a technical CEO/Founders at dev tool startups. So here is an absolute minimal-effort playbook. 
**Audience Building:**
- Send LinkedIn connection requests to the target audience (Free: 20/day, 100/week; Paid: 50/day, 250/week).
- Respond to comments on your posts meaningfully—avoid generic responses like "great" or "thanks."
**Content Creation:**
- Pick one concept/trigger word that you want to own. You want to be brought up when that trigger word comes up in your target audience conversations.
- Record a quick 30-minute call weekly (no prep needed). Ask: What happened this week?, What was surprising or challenging?, What did you learn?
- Extract 2-3 insights, connected to your concept/trigger word, write short posts, or have someone ghostwrite for you.
**Conversions:**
- Connect with people who engage with your content. Follow up with a simple message: "Hi, thanks for engaging! Let me know if you ever need help with XYZ."
- Measure conversions/impact through "How did you find out about us?" style attribution.
If interested in this stuff, [give it a read](https://www.markepear.com/blog/linkedin-ceo-founder-playbook), there are more nuggets in there. 
### 2. Memelord → tool for meme marketers
If you remember my article on [“How to market to developers on Twitter (learnings from 4 months of Supabase feed)”](https://www.markepear.com/blog/developer-marketing-twitter) you know that their secret is freaking great memes. Someone from Subabase even said that they sometimes feel like “a meme company that also does infra”. 
Anyhow, I found a tool for meme marketers: [memelord.tech](http://memelord.tech). You get insights on what memes are trending, how to use them + a meme editor. 
They also have some cool meme libraries including a [programmer meme gallery](https://memelord.tech/programming-memes). Turns out Replit CEO Amjad Masad uses them (as well as beehiiv CEO, Semrush marketing team, and more).

I just signed up for [their newsletter](https://memelord.tech/blog) and the first issue I got was good: a breakdown of an Elon Musk meme. 
Will play more with this and report back to you. 
### 3. PostHog “design our billboard” campaign
Some time ago James Hawkings, CEO of Posthog dropped this tweet

[See on X](https://x.com/james406/status/1854557581030670478)
And people proposed some great ideas (examples below). 
But most importantly **they seem to be crushing it**. This is a comment from a person who saw those billboards all around San Francisco that sums up what you are hoping to happen with a campaign like that.

[Charles Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wololo/) who runs their marketing shared a few of those beauties on LinkedIn (give him a follow btw, when he shares his thoughts on marketing it is always click-worthy). Enjoy!
