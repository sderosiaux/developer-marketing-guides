[Cecilia Stallsmith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecistallsmith/) is a platform and developer GTM investor, consultant, ex-director of platform marketing at Slack, ex-devrel, and platform ecosystem manager at Box. 
Yeah, likely knows what she’s talking about. 
Recently wrote an article on the good and bad of developer marketing. Gold. 
Here is a TLDR, but [go read the whole thing](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/developer-marketing-doesnt-suck-how-to-cecilia-stallsmith%3FtrackingId=QDnQTJstSWGj5P70TH1ZPg%253D%253D/?trackingId=QDnQTJstSWGj5P70TH1ZPg%3D%3D&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=40-what-is-good-and-bad-dev-marketing-awesome-youtube-video-and-a-home-page-header-idea).
**Bad: Tone-deaf Content
  * Do nothing
  * Try to out-market a weak product
  * Forget about the other audiences

**Good: Show don’t tell
  * Your marketing site matters, but your docs REALLY MATTER
  * Be Succinct
  * Content marketing has to be high-value
  * Provide a variety of onramps

###  2. **"Between to Nerds" Video from SST**
This is one of the most interesting content pieces I have seen in dev tools recently 👇
Comes from SST and believe it or not is a comedy video created to promote integrations.
That's right.
So SST integrated with Astro and instead of creating "just another how-to use X+Y" video they created this:
  * A copy of "Between Two Ferns" comedy show
  * With one of the founders of Astro framework which they integrated recently
  * Where they don't really talk about integration too much ;)
  * And reportedly got a ton of signups from this

It was a fun brand play but got way more views than a tutorial ever could.
And it connected with their audience in a human way that will be remembered (and shared).
Nice.
