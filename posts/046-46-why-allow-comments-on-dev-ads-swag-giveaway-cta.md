# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Why you may want to leave comments open on your ads

Many folks suggest closing the comments on your ads, especially on Reddit. 
But then you do nothing more than a banner ad. 
James Zayner figured why not take the challenge and engage with (angry/bored) Redditors.
That resulted in:
“… **praise from the onlookers** and others just there to participate in the fun. 
The **CTR on this ad was 4x the benchmark** CTR of Reddit ads campaigns. There was a significant **spike in self-reported attribution sign-ups** pointing to Reddit and this ad. “
Here is what it looked like.
**Redditor** : Let me promote my reinvention of the wheelheeleelell  
**James Zayner** : Yeah, but wheels have become significantly better over time. They used to be made out of stone.
**Redditor** : It’s new! We call it smtp  
**James Zayner:** I bet you have a nice notification service.
**Redditor** : ChatGPT has entered the chat   
**James Zayner:** We have a ChatGPT integration in our UI
**Redditor** : Hi social media manger. How much are you getting paid  
**James Zayner:** A lot
**Redditor** : Over engineered. Doesn't solve anything new.  
**James Zayner** : It does if you want dynamic preferences to prevent your marketing team from spamming all of your users.
**Redditor** : I worked for Slack. All you need to do is create a workflow with a webhook. From there, any of these will be able to do the same without writing custom code.  
**James Zayner:** Yes, it's that simple _shrug_
So maybe next time you turn the comments off, consider taking the brave route ;)

### 2. Narrow initial positioning from Snyk
In dev tools, you really can solve the problem for a narrow market and extend to adjacent markets over time.
‍**Use*that** -> Snyk did.
