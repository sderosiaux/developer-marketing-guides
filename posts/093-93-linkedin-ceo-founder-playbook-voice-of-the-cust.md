# Developer marketing insights
### 1. LinkedIn CEO/founder playbook
David Reed grew Gong's LinkedIn powerhouse. Then went to Clari and grew their CEO/founder profile to 30k followers and engaging. 
And he shared his playbook for growing executive profiles in a way that drives results for the company in this talk:
[ #196: Drive | LinkedIn Growth Tips Every B2B CEO and Founder Needs to Know with Devin Reed, Founder of The Reeder B2B Marketing with Dave Gerhardt · Episode open.spotify.com/episode/6EGha0wyH2ssBAOUqwTjmY?si=bc7709f9af0945b9&nd=1&dlsi=6370a59d238b4ef6 ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a335d5a196f4064e77bb99928) ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6EGha0wyH2ssBAOUqwTjmY?si=bc7709f9af0945b9&nd=1&dlsi=6370a59d238b4ef6&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=93-linkedin-ceo-founder-playbook-voice-of-the-customer-in-ads-and-perfect-socks)
My takeaways:
  * “**Know** who we are, **like** what we are about, and **trust** we can help them”
  How to sell this to a CEO:** Tie this to your CEOs goals, every CEO has a short list of goals for the year
  Founder still doesn’t want to be “that person”:** if you are complaining that we are not different, not creating pipeline/MQLs enough, not a first choice → this is how you change that. 
  Pick “one word to own”.** You want to spark word of mouth, especially the one that happens behind closed doors. When there is an important meeting going on, your trigger word pops up, you come to mind, and people go to take a demo. That is the dream but it is doable. 
  Pick one focus persona:** A good exercise is to ask your sales team if someone signs up for a demo what the role is you are really hoping for. If someone comes to your booth at the conference then who that is?
  Content pillars/topics:** People want to know what their peers are seeing/thinking/doing. Figure out ~3 core ideas you want to talk about. 
  “But I don’t have time”, says CEO:** Take 20min a week for an idea brain dump. No prep, recorded interview with that founder (or other SME). You direct it so that you get something that touches content pillars. 
  Good questions to ask your CEO: “** What happened this week?”,”What was surprising?”,”What was something you learned?”, “What annoyed you?”, “What something someone said you didn’t like?”, “What did you hate this week?”, “What did you love this week?”
  Metrics and results:** self-reported attribution works fine. You should see more people mention your CEO, target persona engaging with content etc. 

### 2. Use the voice of the customer in ads

I started following [Dan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-ni/), CEO of TLDR a few months ago. He shares learnings from his days building ScraperAPI and then technical TLDR newsletter. 
This is a super powerful tip that I also share with founders and dev marketers a ton when asked about how to improve the copy of ads, website, and organic posts. 
**“Use the actual words, phrases your dev audience is using. Ideally your ideal user/customer profiles.”**
By doing that you are almost guaranteed to resonate. 
The questions that can help you surface those words/phrases/themes are:
  * How do you explain our product to other devs?
  * What sucks about X problem?
  * Why did you switch from Y?

And then follow up with why, tell me more etc. 
And incorporate it into your website/ads/content.
