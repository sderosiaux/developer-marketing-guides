# Developer marketing insights

## 1. A trick for estimating your ICP audience size on Reddit

The core tactic: "Reddit Ads Manager lets you do that when you are setting up the ad campaign. You don't need to run anything. Just play with the targeting."

This allows developers to estimate ideal customer profile audience size in specific subreddits without launching actual campaigns.

## 2. Interactive visual on the Typesense website header

TypeSense demonstrates their "lightning-fast" search capability directly on their homepage through a functional demo showing "2 million recipes in milliseconds."

**Key strategies highlighted:**
- **Go interactive**: Embed working demos instead of static screenshots
- **Lead with one clear benefit**: "Lightning-fast open source search" with transparent messaging
- **Address competitors head-on**: They name Algolia and Elasticsearch, explaining their differentiation

The guidance emphasizes: "Don't just talk about speed or simplicity. Show it. Give devs something they can test and compare."

## 3. Extreme dogfooding and early-stage content from RevenueCat

Features Jacob Eiting, CEO of RevenueCat, discussing several key strategies:

**Educational content as a magnet**: RevenueCat published detailed content about implementing mobile subscriptions—"essentially giving away the recipe"—which outranked Apple's documentation and drove early signups.

**Key takeaways include:**
- Developers trust transparency; oversharing builds credibility
- Educate on "Why" alongside "How" (explaining statistical thinking behind pricing tests)
- Identify "should-be-simple" problems that actually create complexity
- Build owned test environments through strategic acquisitions for real-time feedback
- Humanize marketing with authentic tone; "People sense BS immediately"
