[Elena Verna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenaverna/) is one of the top minds in B2B PLG. 
And recently wrote this post that clarified some things for me, especially in the context of dev tool GTM. 
There are 3 motions, not one.
**1. End-user focused Person: Individual contributor (IC) developer
  * Goal: get the first IC dev into the product
  * KPI: Sign up / team trial / product download
  * Tactics: Dev content on your blog, Youtube content, social listening, open-source projects

**2. Teammates focused Person: other ICs on the team
  * Goal: get teammates into the product
  * KPI: # of invites / # signups per account / # downloads per account
  * Tactics: Invitation flows, great how-to guides you can send people to

**3. Buyer focused Persona: team leader / VP Engineering / CTO
  * Goal: get the team leader sold on the value prop
  * KPI: # of opportunities / $ pipeline
  * Tactics: Linkedin thought leadership, G2 reviews, business-focused case studies

When you think about it this way you don’t push buyers to “try the tool” or talk to IC devs about “enterprise benefits”. 
And to really make an impact with your PLG motion you need to make all three work.
