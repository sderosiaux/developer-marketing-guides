# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Developer marketing funnel

[Matteo Tittarelli ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-titta/)is a startup growth advisor and his [article on developer marketing funnel](https://titta.substack.com/p/the-developer-marketing-funnel) definitely shows that he worked with dev tools. 
Here are my takeaways.
In classic B2B you have stages like consideration, awareness, and conversion. **In dev tools, you have exploration, demo, and the internal sale.*Exploration.** Help people see what your tool does, how it works with other tools, and what is special about it:
  * Communicate clear and compelling **differentiation**. Whatever it is, speed, feature, price, let people know. 
  * Make **navigation** to the right content easy. Use interactive navbars that show more on hover. Explicit one-liner copy. Let people find things easily. 
  * Show that your tool works with **their stack**. Logos of tools you integrate with, SDK code snippets, and testimonials help with that. 
  * Make it easy to find **quick starts and API docs**. Use good navigation UX, search, articles, and CTAs to show it. 

**Demo**. Show the result of how things will work when implemented:
  * Show a **working sample**. Could be a sandbox, a working example or template, or a live app. Something that shows the result that they can experience. 
  * Speaking of **templates**. A library that is searchable by use cases, language, and framework can go a long way. 
  * You also need **step-by-step guides** for when people actually want to implement those examples or templates they saw. 
  * Show how your tool works within the ecosystem with **architectural scenarios**. 

**Internal sale.** Helps devs sell it to other people involved in buying dev tools:
  * Make **use cases and solution pages** easily findable for less technical visitors. 
  * Show all the **enterprise features** on pricing and/or enterprise pages. 
  * Prepare a **“convince your boss” content pack**. Include value prop, features and benefits, case studies, ROI calculators, pricing, “email this to your boss” templates etc. 

Do all that and you will be fine ;)
