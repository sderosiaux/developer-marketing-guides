# Developer marketing insights
### 1. AI engines VS docs and what Clerk is doing about it
There is a lot happening with docs and AI coding tools, AI chatbots etc. 
One thing I’ve experienced, and heard from others is the rise of **support tickets for hallucinated methods or libraries**. As in:
  * devs didn’t go to the docs to search, 
  * they just asked AI engine to read them and give them a how to,
  * it gave them a how to that uses methods/libraries that don’t exist. 

Don’t have a good solution for that yet (pls share yours). But this is an interesting idea from [Clerk.com](http://Clerk.com) that helps with that slightly (assuming ppl did go to your docs).

You can safely assume a big % of people will try and prompt their way to a working code. 
Why not give people a prompt that has some guardrails around it? 
[You can see that prompt here. ](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)I like it. I wonder if this will become a bet practice. And generally what will happen to the docs that will more and more be read by AI engines not people.
