# Developer marketing insights
### 1. “Developer facing startup” a must-read for dev marketers and founders
[Adam Frankl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamfrankl/), the guy who was the first marketing guy at 3 dev tool unicorns, wrote a book on dev marketing!

Bought it, read it, and loved it. 
It is focused on **marketing for early-stage dev tool startup founders**. Ideally for products that are solving a net new problem. But if you are marketing dev tools you’ll find it valuable either way. 
I was thinking about doing a TLDR but then I thought, just read it. It will probably be the best $10 (and a few hours) you’ll ever spend. 
I don’t necessarily agree with everything (probably a post coming) but it is a fantastic resource nonetheless.

### 2. Learnings from running Reddit ads + a great meme ad example

[Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayildirim/) runs a b2b growth agency, and as they started testing recently, Reddit turned out to be a great ad channel for developer personas.
My takeaways from his takeaways 😉 :
  * You can Target a very focused community by going after specific subreddits. Be intentional with grouping similar subreddits into ad groups. 
  * Adjust content to the subreddit, post something that fits that subreddit
  * Run ads to things I can try/do right there product/repo/newsletter etc
  * Low cost to get reach, CPM around $5, CPC around $1.5. It also means you should probably focus on reach and delivering message in-feed rather than try and get people to click-out

A great implementation of that was a meme ad for r/ProgrammerHummor subreddit that [Zach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-f-short/) shared recently
