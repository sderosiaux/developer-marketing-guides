## 1. Learnings from 170+ comments on my HN post
Remember [that Hacker News post ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32191615&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=7-ctas-dev-marketers-on-linkedin-and-learnings-from-hn-comments)about advertising to devs that got a ton of comments on HN? 
I went through those and extracted what (HN) devs think about marketing and ads. 
tldr: 
  * Devs do hate advertising. The level is extreme, unreasonable even. 
  * Devs love swag. Unreasonably so. 
  * Devs appreciate good tutorials and blogs. 
  * Devs only really trust other devs. 
  * Say what you don’t do to build trust. 
  * Devs use a lot of ad blocks. 
  * Podcast ads work. 
  * Say what you do, let me try, wait for me to reach out. 
  * Devs think marketing == promotion and ads.

### 2. Developer-focused CTA from Plaid
Action-focused copy usually converts better than generic "sign up". 
Some teams like Vercel or Auth0 do "Start building " but that doesn't work for any dev product. 
I really like how Plaid uses "Get API keys" CTA copy which is super dev-focused and explains well what will happen on the other side of that button.

### 3. Content from Adam Frankl 
Found an awesome developer marketing creator [Adam Frankl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamfrankl/). 
As he says (probably a bit too often): _"I have been the first Marketing VP at 3 dev-facing unicorns: Neo4j, Sourcegraph, and JFrog."_
So yeah, he probably knows a thing or two. 
[Went through 30+ of his short essays](https://typeshare.co/adamfrankl) (which he also publishes on LI/Twitter) and they are gold.

### 5. "Subscribe" CTA from the Interrupt blog

CTAs on developer-focused blogs are tricky. 
You don't want to be pushy but you do want to push to the next action. 
I came across the Interrupt blog from Memfault which is loved by edge developers.
