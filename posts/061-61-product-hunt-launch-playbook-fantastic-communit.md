[Matteo Titarelli ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-titta/)is a growth advisor specializing in early-stage companies. And recently he shared a playbook he uses for PH launches. 
The entire thing is [available (for free) as a Reforge Artifact ](https://www.reforge.com/artifacts/product-hunt-launch-checklist-by-matteo-tittarelli)and following it helped Matteo get 3 different tools to the #1 of the day/week on PH. 
It is all nicely organized and very tactical. Filled with templates and examples like this:

Super valuable stuff. Highly recommended. 
### 2. Trieve newsletter sponsorship ad 
Awesome sponsorship ad from Trieve in the Cassidy Williams newsletter.
Not sure who wrote it but it must have been a dev ;) It is just so refreshingly to the point.
💚 What I like:

  "What is it":** A product description gives you no fluff "what it is". Feels like something from "Hacker News launch" almost.
  "What it compares to" | "Why should I care"** : They compare vs a well-known dev tool in the space. And this is great, helps the dev anchor with something they know. Helps them understand why this could be valuable. They even give you a life app where you can see for yourself.
  "How can I test it for myself":** They offer free credits to play with in a cloud version.

This ad does it so gracefully and quickly it is just hard not to love.
