# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Signal sales playbooks
There is a ton of talk about GTM engineers, AI SDRs, Signal-based sales, and all that 2025 GTM. Rightfully so. The tools are here, the enrichment ([Clay](https://www.clay.com/), [Freckle](https://www.freckle.io/)), the signal brokers ([CommonRoom](https://www.commonroom.io/), [Reo.dev](http://Reo.dev), [Koala](https://getkoala.com/)), website deanonymization ([Rb2b](https://www.rb2b.com/), [Vector](https://www.vector.co/), [warmly.ai)](https://www.warmly.ai/). 
But if you don’t make those things actionable, it doesn’t matter that much, does it? You need playbooks. 
Found some great ones in this article: [“The best automated GTM plays you’re not running”](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/automated-gtm-plays) in Kyle Poyar Growth Unhinged newsletter.

Was thinking about extracting a few of those plays in here. But the original article is so well laid out with tools, 1-2-3 how-to’s and no fluff, I think it is just better if you go in there and read it.

### 2. Guerrilla marketing ideas
What if they don’t let you into the conference room?

They went guerilla and set up a **billboard truck** in front of the conference area. I also heard/saw about companies doing **branded taco trucks or coffee bikes** in front of major meetups/conferences. Fun little play, but since this is different (still) it can make a splash.
Btw this is another instance of me seeing those LED advertisement trucks around conferences. Does anyone have a trusted vendor for this? → Let me know. 
Also, recently saw this idea of **reverse graffiti “ads” on dirty pavements** , which I definitely haven’t seen in dev tools yet. Edgy and fun if you ask me.
