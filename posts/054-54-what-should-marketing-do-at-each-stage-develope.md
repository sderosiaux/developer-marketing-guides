# Developer marketing insights
### 1. What should marketing do at each stage of the dev tool startup journey?
Not all marketing tactics are made equal. Especially at a dev tool startup. 
Depending on the stage in which you are, I suggest the following.

‍**No product market fit yet: **Focus on getting feedback.** Try to get people to talk to you.
  * Try many different channels at a small scale to see where you get the most feedback/interested folks coming from. 

  * Prioritize early-adopter-heavy channels where people don’t have super-high product expectations. 

‍**Have product-market fit: **Focus on finding one scalable channel.** Make sure that it has a product-market-channel-model fit. 
  * Scale this channel. Optimize it. Make it efficient. Find tactics that support the growth of it. 
  * Focus the vast majority of your efforts on this single channel. 

‍**Have one scalable channel: **Diversify your channel portfolio.** Add more scalable channels to your mix. 
  * All channels saturate. All have limitations. Be ready for when your scalable channel cannot deliver the signup/pipeline numbers you need. 
  * Make experimentation and finding new channels part of the process. Divide the budget into 80-20 between optimization of the scalable channel and experimentation on new channels.

### 2. Developer Go to Market report
Folks from [Reo.dev](http://reo.dev) published an interesting [report on GTM for developer-first companies. ](https://reodotdev.substack.com/p/does-developer-activity-actually)
They connected developer activity in the docs/open-source repos/product/website/discords/installations with the sales data in the CRM. 
The core of the report was to answer the following question:
**Does more dev activity mean higher purchase intent?**
It could have been that your free tier or open-source users will just not convert. And whatever metric you are growing will not convert to revenue. 
**The reality is that yes it does convert to purchase intent.** And it is the most visible at the bottom of the funnel (Sales Qualified Account, Opportunity etc) where teams were 3x more likely to have a high dev activity score.

[Read the article](https://reodotdev.substack.com/p/does-developer-activity-actually)
But the qualification could be biased due to scoring that includes dev activity, right?
Here was another interesting thing, though:
“We saw that on average a significant 83.4% of accounts with any kind of developer activity around the analysed tenant’s product and associated ecosystem were not in their CRM.”
Any good devrel knows it intuitively. The “invisible” devrel activities do impact sales (but don’t get credit for it). This is a good data point for your next budget discussion.
Anyhow, it seems that **including that dev activity in your sales scoring systems is a logical next step.**
And if you do, then your sales team can reach out to high-dev activity accounts (ideally the buyer persona not dev users) and have a bigger chance of closing it.

###  2. **Supabase product navbar tab design**
The product tab in your navbar is likely the most visited one on your site.
And there are a million ways of organizing information in there.
**But ultimately, you want to help people understand what this product is about at a glance.**
Even before they click. Even if they never click.
And how do you explain your product to devs?  
By answering common questions:
  * "What are the capabilities/features, specifically?"
  * "What do people use it for in producution, specifically?"
  * "Ok, so how is it different than ... I used before/use now?"

**Supabase does it really nicely:**
