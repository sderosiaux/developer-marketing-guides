# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Masterclass into YouTube influencers from Clerk
[Alex Rapp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderrapp/) and [Nick Parsons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nparsons/) together with [Gonto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgonto/) from [Hypergrowth partners](https://www.hypergrowthpartners.com/) shared their experiences setting up and growing the YouTube creator/influencer motion at [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).

These are my takeaways:
  * You can **just reach out** to creators and ask if they’d be interested in trying your product. Simple as that. This is a nice tweak to transactional “will you promote us” outreach. “They are paying people to talk about them” is not the vibe you want to go for anyway. So creating that human relationship from the get-go helps. 
  Which format to choose?** Doing long-form sponsored videos focused on their product alone didn’t really work. Switching to a format where their product was a part of a larger workflow/app was the way to go. 
  Give people creative freedom**. They asked influencers to propose their content. They (should) know their audience best after all. Additionally, there was no push for publishing deadlines and a safe space to talk about the problems with the product. 
  People didn’t click on links** in the video description. They looked for directional impact based on the correlation between videos being published and signup spikes
  To*find creators on auto-pilot** they created YouTube scrapers that would look for specific keywords like “Clerk” or “React” in titles/descriptions etc. To vet them they looked at 10k+ creators with good engagement proxy metrics (view-to-subscriber ratio, likes, comments etc)
  * They invested slightly more (60-40) in smaller creators with bigger growth potential than established, big personal brands. 
  They treated it as a partnership** : The Clerk team shared metrics, learnings from other creators, and feedback on the results they saw. They wanted it to work both ways. They want creators to succeed. 
  Engagement setup** : In the testing phase they were open to what creators wanted. After a while, they gathered some data from various creators they worked with and used that to negotiate. Another approach you can use is just paying creators on CPM (cost per 1000 views). That ranged from $20-55 for across Hypergrowths portfolio companies.
