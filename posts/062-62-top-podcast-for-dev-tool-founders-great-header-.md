# Developer marketing insights

## 1. Scaling DevTools Podcast

Jack Bridger hosts what Jakub considers the premier podcast for dev tool founders. The show features "tactical, real-life stories from founders, first marketers, and dev tool GTM advisors." Three featured episodes cover strategies relevant to the dev tool space, making it a resource frequently recommended to founders and marketers seeking actionable guidance.

## 2. Neon's Header Copy Strategy

Neon demonstrates effective developer-focused messaging by avoiding generic claims. Their homepage leads with "fully managed serverless Postgres" paired with technical benefits: "Autoscaling, branching, bottomless storage" and explains the underlying architecture: "Separate storage and compute."

**Key insight**: Even when selling to executives, technical decision-makers typically evaluate infrastructure tools. Targeting developers first—who champion solutions internally—remains more effective than assuming top-down buyer personas review these products directly.

## 3. Vercel's Templates Gallery

Vercel's template library exemplifies effective developer engagement through:

- **Navigation**: Easy-to-find CTA in navbar with descriptive one-liners
- **Library page**: Use-case-based filtering with tags; thumbnail previews and concise descriptions
- **Template pages**: Live results, tutorials, and action-focused CTAs ("Deploy" rather than "Sign up")

**Purpose**: Templates help developers understand capabilities, discover relevant examples, experience products without commitment, and progress through their evaluation journey.
