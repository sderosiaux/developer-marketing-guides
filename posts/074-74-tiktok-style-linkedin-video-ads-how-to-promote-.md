# Developer marketing insights
### 1. TikTok-style ads on LinkedIn
Itamar has been sharing 🔥 content on developer ads lately. 
One concept that he goes on about is **the importance of creative,** especially for the cold ad layer. 
It should land the message yes, but if it doesn’t grab attention and stop the scroll it is not going to work. 
And those low-production TikTok-style video ads do just that:
  they are different than 99% of your feed** so it stops the scroll and gets you to watch
  * they are entertaining, **catch and keep attention** for long enough to land the message

Two examples below (click out to see them on LinkedIn):

### 2. How to promote your articles on Reddit
This is a very interesting approach from **[PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/)**.
They could have published an article on their blog and posted a link to Reddit.
Instead, **they just posted an entire article, 3851 words**. That post got 360 upvotes and made it to the top of r/rust. Wow.
