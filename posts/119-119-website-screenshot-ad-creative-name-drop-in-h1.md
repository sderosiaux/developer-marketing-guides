### 1. Website screenshot ad creative
I saw this ad the other day:

[See on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/lecode-89/comments/1lav43w/fast_affordable_whatsapp_api_6mo_unlimited/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_content=1&p=1&utm_term=22)
For some reason I haven’t seen this style of creative at all and there is a lot I like here. Redditors seem to like it (32 upvotes) too. 
What I like:
  Looks like a website** , sends me to the website. Something refreshingly obvious and transparent about this. 
  * Super **clear*H1 copy** (what it is + differentiator) and **subhead listing capabilities Transparent/explicit **Reddit ad Headline** with price and capabilities. No “supercharging”, or “10x your productivity” in there. 
  * Additional info scattered around CTAs, and start trust factors.

I don’t know, there are clear reasons why you strip the ad of all those details. But when people are zigging, zagging is the way to go.
