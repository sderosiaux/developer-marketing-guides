# Developer marketing insights
### 1. List of signals that suggest people may want to talk to sales
I talked about it a few times already when discussing [developer sales motion](https://www.developermarkepear.com/blog/selling-to-developers). Devs generally don’t want to talk to you. Definitely not right after they signup for a free account. Maybe not ever. 
But there are moments in their journey when they actually don’t mind (or even want to). That is even more true for a technical buyer persona within that account.
**Ok, but how do you know when those moments appear?**
You combine signals from the product, docs, website, community slacks or discords, GitHub repos, socials etc. 
[Kevin White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevbosaurus/) from [Common Room](https://www.commonroom.io/) created a fantastic resource listing 100+ of those signals.

This spreadsheet is pure gold. Not everything is strictly dev-focused but most of it is very relevant to any B2B sales motion. 
Share it with your sales team and they will probably love you for it.

### 2. Developer marketing metrics (how I see it)

What metrics should you look at in the developer marketing motion?
Finally wrote down my thoughts on it.
𝗧𝗟𝗗𝗥 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗯𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀:
  Look only at metrics that help you make decisions.** If you track metrics, create dashboards but don't use them for decision-making rethink your metrics
  Use a mix of self-reported and software attribution** to understand where people come from and what converts
  Look at both leading and lagging metrics** to optimize programs, activities, and budget allocation. But understand the difference and purpose of each.

𝗜 𝗴𝗼 𝗱𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼:
  * Why do you even track marketing metrics?
  * How do you track attribution in developer marketing?
  * What KPIs should the developer marketing organization own?
  * What metrics to monitor for each stage of the developer journey?
  * And more

### 3. Interesting dev blog CTA idea from V7
CTAs in technical articles is a tricky subject:
  * Go too aggressive and "obviously an ad" and devs ignore it
  * Go too subtle and you may not get the reader’s attention at all

I like how V7 approached it in [this article](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/f1-score-guide):
