[Zevi Reinitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zevi/) runs (not only) marketing at an early-stage dev tool startup called Livecycle. And some time ago he wrote down learnings from growing [Livecycle’s Preevy repo](https://github.com/livecycle/preevy) from 0 to 1500 stars. 
Here is a tldr.
**Prerequisites: Basic repo health: A **clear descriptio** n of what your tool does
  * Well-structured **readme**. Show what you do, code snippets, UI gifs
  * A **docs** site you want to send people to

**The first 100 stars - artificial growth: Kick-off message to **friends and family Ask the **neighbors** in our shared office space
  * Show it off (for free) at **conferences First **launch announcements** on social media

**Beyond the first 100: **Content creation** : present the tool, directly and indirectly, do listicles, 
  Content distribution** : syndication, Reddit and socials, your own blog (SEO)
  GitHub lists:** PR to get it on every list that makes sense
  Other Sites and Newsletters** : reach out to wherever you can
  Relevant communities and dark social** : go to Slack, Discord, Reddit, Whatsapp, LinkedIn and Facebook and spread the word
  Paid ads campaigns:** Ethical Ads, Reddit (subreddits), Twitter (keywords) worked for them
  Influencers** : list influencers, find collaborative things, reach out to them
  Podcasts and promotions** : get yourself on whatever lets you
  Use cases testimonials** : reach out to bloggers in your space, and see if they’d want to try your tool (and write about it). Some will
  Hackernews** : both show HN and share regular content. 
  Social media retargeting** : whoever engaged got a templated message inviting them to try/star
  Shamelessly promote other people and projects** : when you can promote other people’s projects (and yours with it)
  My (crazy) Github retargeting experiment** : reach out to folks who were stargazers of other similar repos. Just ask. 
  Celebrate milestones:** in public share your milestones and more people will get on the train

###  2. **Header with tabs from Appsmith**
What to put in the header when your dev tool does a lot?
I like how Appsmith approaches it on their new website.
