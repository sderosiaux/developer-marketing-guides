# Developer marketing insights
### 1. "How it works" crossover from Mux 
The problem with presenting API is that it is hidden. It gets the job done in the background. 
So it is not "attractive" in the way some other dev tools can be. 
But you can: 
  * show the end result and how it gets the job done. 
  * show how easy it is to use. 
  * let people play with something interactive to make it real. 

𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗠𝘂𝘅, 𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗼 𝗔𝗣𝗜, 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁.

Found this awesome crossover on their homepage.They give you: 
  * devvy language that just says what it does without high-level fluff 
  * code, input/outputs 
  * end result of your API call, to make it real 
  * demo to get the feel real-time 

Love it.
