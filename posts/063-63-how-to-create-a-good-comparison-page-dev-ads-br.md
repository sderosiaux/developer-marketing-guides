# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Dev ads breakdowns from Zachary Short
[Zachary Short](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-f-short/) is a practitioner running demand gen for a dev tool product Gravitee.
He is also posting awesome ad breakdowns (many of them dev tools or PLG), memes, and haikus. Sometimes all combined ;)
Here is a good example:

[Read on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zachary-f-short_if-youre-trying-to-educate-developers-on-activity-7174018977856122880-2chd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
Agreed. Specific dev ads, that have diagrams (that are unreasonably effective) have a better chance of getting a click. 
I’d add that doing comparison campaigns is so underrated yet so helpful to the devs who are struggling with the problem/considering switching. 
Which brings me to my second point today. 
### 2. How to create a good dev tool comparison page
You vs competitor comparison pages. For some reason, this is a controversial subject. In dev tools especially. Here is my “controversial” opinion: 
**You vs Competitor comparison pages are valuable. Both for you and your users.**
Figured I’d put together my thoughts on it. For a few days, I looked around dev tool vs pages. Found many “not-so-great” examples and a few really good ones. Combined it with my experiences and wrote a guide on how to do it right.

You’ll get:
  * Why create comparison pages (and when you shouldn’t)
  * What makes a good comparison page
  * My baseline for you vs competitor page
  * Examples of dev tool comparison pages 

This is my baseline, by the way, if you are wondering.

### 3. Funny and memorable competitive billboard ad from Statsig
You have a big incumbent, everyone knows them. Use it to anchor your brand.
And tell the story of how you do things differently.
But first, make people see you. And remember you in the next conversation when the big known brand or a category comes up.
**And*being*funny*is*one*of*the best ways of getting attention and being remembered**.
