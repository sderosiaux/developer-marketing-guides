# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Clerk’s experiment with turning off newsletter partnerships
So this is a fantastic story and a reminder that some activities may have significant incremental impact even if they are not attributable. 
Not much to add to this so just read Alex’s post.

**I had a similar experience** one time when I looked at our Twitter ads a couple years back. I saw that they didn’t drive much activated signups. Being data driven as I was, I pushed to turn off those ads. To my surprise signups, direct traffic, and google search dropped by a solid %. 
So, being data driven as I was ;), figured lets run a **geo lift test** and we ran Twitter ads for some geo’s and didn’t for others. The results clearly showed a lift for geo’s where we ran ads. 
**The moral of the story is that you want incrementality not attribution.** And that there is truth in the famous marketing saying “50% of marketing budget is wasted, you just never know which half”. 
After all you'd much rather “waste” 50% while driving ROI from the other 50% (albeit unknown one) than not waste anything but drive poor results. 
Itamar Ben Yair summarized it perfectly in our podcast interview:
“CMO’s are never fired because they couldn’t attribute spent. They get fired because they don’t drive pipeline results”
Here is that interview if you are interested (lots of gems on attribution/incrementality):
Also, my two articles on the subject:

### 2. Developer stickers inspiration library
You probably remember that last week I shared a [conference sponsorship guide](https://christophedujarric.com/2025/11/13/a-guide-frugality-in-offline-events/) where the author said that there are only two types of swag he does: stickers and educational materials. 
Figured it would be cool to share this [sticker inspiration library:](https://stickertop.art/main/)

I came across this one on Hacker News.

Got to say that thread had a few interesting discussions too. Here are three useful comments that are sort of obvious but when people design stickers (or decide not to) they forget about them: 
I used to put stickers on my desktop PC and laptop when I was in my early 20s. Then I realised my laptop was kinda free advertising for whatever companies product I had stuck on the back.
**SparkBomb**
The stickers reflect things I like or find amusing; maybe they'll get a smirk or a chuckle from someone else.
**tlavoie**
Anthropologists of the future will be able to trace my beliefs, humor, and tech stack from my laptop lid alone.
**imwillofficial**
"“Hi I’m Kimberly, can I tell you about my startup” lands way worse than “Hi I’m Kimberly, would you like a dinosaur sticker""
**gcr**
