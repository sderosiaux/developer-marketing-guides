# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Marketing dev tools on Reddit with Aditya Ramakrishnan
It all started with this LinkedIn post:

Which got me started following [Aditya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaramakrishnan/) and learning at ton from his content. 
At some point I figured → “why not go deeper on this?” and so I reached out. The result is this almost [2 hour episode focused 100% on organic Reddit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAiccJ8zoiU&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=125-marketing-dev-tools-on-reddit-and-great-baseline-onboarding-email-from-auth0) marketing for dev tools. Good stuff. 
Some things we talked about: 
  Think of Reddit vibe as a bar during a conference:** People talk. Have opinions (sometimes extreme). Join conversations, comment a lot. Post only when you have something new and be there to answer. 
  Pair a marketer with a technical owner.** The marketer finds/frames threads; the engineer/PM answers. 
  Measure by replies, not upvotes.** Links and karma are ok to track obviously. But you get more insight from qualitative feel of the quality of conversations (or at least a count of replies). 
  When starting build a Reddit muscle before posting/commenting.** First weeks just lurk and earn karma in non-work subs. Then start commenting in your target subs.
  Run a biweekly “dev conversations” show-and-tell.** Share threads, wins/flops, and product insights with PM/Eng/CS. This builds understanding/alignment. 
  Use Reddit Answers:** this is a great new tool for market research basically collating answers/thoughts around tool comparisons, problems within ecosystems etc. You get a summary + links to threads. Great starting point. 

Way more stuff + examples with commentary in the podcast.

### 2. Great baseline onboarding email from Auth0
I love a great baseline. Something that you can start with and iterate from. Nothing fancy but still something good and hard to beat. 
I signed up for Auth0 recently and got this simple onboarding email, which in my book is a great baseline:
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/244304c5-f8f1-404d-b69e-f710eaf31554/image.png)
I love how simple and not overly optimized it is:
  * here is the product
  * here are resources
  * talk to us if you have questions → engioneer will reply

This is exactly what you want as a dev signing up for a new thing. 
One tweak for early stage founders would be to send this from a founder and sign as founder. Maybe make it slightly more dev to dev. 
Another one would be to send it a day after I signed up (not right away), so that it can serve as a reminder / get me back into the app in case I hit problems in the first session.
