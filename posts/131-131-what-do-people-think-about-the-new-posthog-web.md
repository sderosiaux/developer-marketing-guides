# Developer marketing insights
### 1. New Posthog website 
So [posthog.com](http://posthog.com) has a new website. They were always fun and different but this is next level. Still not sure if I love it or not. But one thing is certain. They got a ton of attention with this. Way more than any other website redesign I saw. Ok, maybe PlanetScale got a decent amount as well ([talked about it in #108](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/108-great-linkedin-ad-and-behind-the-scenes-of-planetscale-redesign)).
Here is Posthog designer Cory Watilo sharing that redesign with the world and getting 4778 likes and 652 comments. Without any “Comment WEBSITE to get a link” bs going on in there. Also this is[ an official blog post on it](https://posthog.com/blog/why-os) if you are interested.

Since this was LinkedIn, the vast majority of comments where “amazing congrats” kind of thing. 
I love “different is better than better” approach. But with websites I think there is a component of “it shouldn’t look too different”. Which btw is what most design award winning websites are. Beautiful, memorable, but not converting. 
So I was curious what HN and Reddit crowds think about it. I went through these three (with my silicon friend):
  * [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45217269](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45217269&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=131-what-do-people-think-about-the-new-posthog-website-and-a-fun-announcement-stunt-from-recall-ai)
  * [https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nf6u2r/posthogs_new_os_themed_website/](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nf6u2r/posthogs_new_os_themed_website/)
  * [https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1nf4vyj/posthog_taking_a_different_approach/](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1nf4vyj/posthog_taking_a_different_approach/)

And here are my takeaways.
#### The good
  * “Interesting idea and **nice-looking UI**.” 
  * “I **really like the way their homepage looks** … fun to drag all the windows and icons.” 
  * “**It is wonderful** … should be accessible via a switcher… **bold move**.” 
  * “**I for sure welcome the creativity** and love PostHog for this.” 
  * “Less scattered and disorienting than the **vast majority of modern websites**.” (minority view, but present) 

#### The bad
  * “**Awful idea** … recreating windows… **getting in the way of native browser features**.” 
  * “A **browser within a browser** … **disorienting** … **back button didn’t do anything**.” 
  * “**Breaks the most basic of keyboard functions**.” (no keyboard scrolling) 
  * “Cool concept but **garbage in terms of usability** … **bet the bounce rate will skyrocket**.” 
  * “I’m an engineer evaluating PostHog, and **I bounced**.” 
  * “**Don’t know what I’m supposed to be navigating to**.” 
  * “**Suited more for PC than mobile**.” (mobile jank called out) 
  * Conversion worry: “Fun, but **a disaster for conversions** once launch hype fades.” 

Overall sentiment was negative on Hacker News, Mixed on Reddit but still more on a negative side. 
But. 
What is key is that definitely people on both sides where emotional enough to have heated arguments with “love” and “hate” thrown around a ton. **Getting this much attention with a website rebuild is remarkable. Full stop.**
Reading through the comments I think that with stunts like this **there is a real concern of launch day vs day-2 usage of it,** and that people are accustomed to a classic website experience. 
So perhaps this or other crazy websites could actually be done as a stunt (especially with all those vibecoding tools) and then reverted to a more classic one after the hype is done. Maybe even with a “see classic website” button somewhere during the launch. 
This is the behind the scenes with Cory Watilo (the designer):
### 2. Funding announcement idea from Recall.ai 
How about this idea of sending postcards:
  * Take a nice piece of paper
  * Print your company name on it
  * Print your one liner on it (bonus points for saying what you do ;))
  * Create a list of ICPs with office addresses
  * Send those postcards to them
  * …
  * Wait for ppl to reach out

This is what [Recall.ai](http://Recall.ai) did and I love it. Another example of doing something different rather than just better. Creativity seems to be back in marketing grace ;)
