# Developer marketing insights

## 1. "Devs check out pricing twice"

This LinkedIn post from Adam Frankl articulates an important pattern: developers evaluate pricing at two distinct moments.

**First evaluation:** At the initial stage, developers assess whether the tool fits their team's budget ballpark.

**Second evaluation:** Later, they dive into specifics to complete a purchase or pitch it internally.

The critical insight: "the second never happens if the first check goes bad."

**Key takeaway:** Developers won't proceed to detailed pricing review if initial pricing appears unreasonable, unclear, or difficult to understand. Transparent, straightforward pricing is essential for moving prospects forward.

## 2. What to do when your dev tool is "just" faster

When speed/scalability is your primary differentiator, showing beats telling.

**The challenge:** Developers can't easily test infrastructure tools (databases, observability platforms) to verify performance claims themselves—setting up realistic test scenarios requires significant effort.

**The solution:** Create benchmarks demonstrating your advantage through controlled comparisons.

**Astro's approach:**
- Names direct competitors explicitly
- Explains technical reasons for superior performance
- Displays benchmarks prominently on the homepage
- Links to full reports citing trusted sources

**Core principle:** If speed is your USP, back it up with credible data that builds trust immediately.

## 3. Pulling off a sidekick product: Hacker News search by Algolia

Algolia generates over 80% of referral traffic from a free tool: Search Hacker News.

**Why it works:**
- Solves a genuine problem (HackerNews lacks native search)
- Demonstrates product capability through use
- Shows rather than tells how their search engine performs
- Matches HackerNews design/branding, feeling like a natural extension

**Result:** Users experience Algolia's quality firsthand, then naturally discover the parent product.
