# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Scaling organic social proof with ads

This is great because:
  * You take an actual authentic user/customer post (success story) 
  * You add context to it with copy, CTA, and other elements like underscore/arrows, to make it easier to grasp.
  * Those stories don’t happen often so you better get the most of it when they do.
  * Bonus points if you link out not to your site but to the original post or a G2 review if you do that. 

What I liked about this particular one is sharing enough to show interest but not enough to tell the entire story.

### 2. Devs evaluate, whatever your go-to-market motion is
Whatever you go to market motion is, at some point, some dev will be comparing you to other options. 
It will happen whether your GTM is top-down, bottom-up, middle-out, PLG, community-first, founder-led, or whatever led it is. When people buy software they evaluate and compare.

The process may start from the bottom up (end-user dev) or the top down (buyer CTO). But it will happen. Don’t neglect that evaluation stage. 
**Whatever you do elsewhere may not matter if you don’t have this nailed.** People will “evaluate you out”. So make sure your website materials, your community work on Reddit or Discords, and your profiles on review sites support that evaluation. 
The dev evaluation phase will happen with or without you in it.
