# Developer marketing insights
### 1. Wiz booths are just next-level
Imagine a cloud security, enterprise-focused company. Serious risks, serious buyers, serious product. Got it?
Ok, now think of the most important conference of the year for CISOs. RSAC. Got it?
Ok, now imagine their booth. 
Dark blue, serious, big logos on the walls. People are wearing suits. 
Great, now look at Wiz, one of the strongest brands in the security space.

They created a supermarket-themed booth Wiz-mart with products speaking to the audience's pains, problems, tools, and everyday life. They took audience empathy to the next level.
Things like:
  * CDR / CSPM / CNAP / DSPM / CIEM - Acronym soup
  * Cloudy Clouds chips “For a successful cloud strategy forecast”
  * Cloud visibility spray
  * AI magic (washing) powder
  * Kubernetes All-in-one (dishwasher) pods
  * and more

The entire booth with those little puns. Must have been so much fun working on it. 
You can watch the booth here:

This is just soo good. Connecting the brand with problems and making this so shareable. I know there are words that as a marketer I shouldn’t use but I do think they made this thing go viral ;)
Btw, I didn’t know but they went from being unrecognized to the most memorable brand in security in just a few years. 
Allegedly, their then-new CMO had 2 months to prep for the biggest conf of the year RSAC. She figured how about we do something different, memorable. And they created a “Wiz of Oz”-themed booth. People loved it and the rest as you can see is history (of dev marketing) in the making. 
Heard about it on Lenny’s podcast. A must listen.

### 2. Measuring the success of Reddit ads (and similar channels)

Many channels, especially with devs, cannot be measured with direct: Click → Signup → Paying funnel. But that doesn't mean that channels don’t work, you just have to look at them differently. 
[Itamar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itamar-ben-yair-053271174/) shares his story with Reddit ads which didn’t produce (UTM) clicks for one of his clients but did give incremental lift in the metric you actually care about: Sales Qualified Leads. 
I remember having a **similar learning with Twitter ads a while back**. We turned them off and it didn’t change the amount of Twitter-attributed traffic we got. But the signups dropped significantly. Then we ran a Geo test: US got the ads, but everyone else didn’t. And we saw the signups for US go back up with Twitter traffic at the same level. 
**The impact may still be there even with no (attributable) clicks. Especially with devs.**
So beware of tracking things through clicks only. Look at self-reported attribution or simple correlation tests (that are in essence what Marketing Mix Modelling is). I go deeper into [my views on metrics and attribution in this article. ](https://www.markepear.com/blog/developer-marketing-metrics)
By the way, one of the creatives that I recommend everyone to try is this all-text style:
