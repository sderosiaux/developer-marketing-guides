# Developer marketing insights
### 1. LinkedIn video ads for tech audiences with Itamar Ben Yair
Episode #4 of [Going Deepear Into Dev Marketing](https://open.spotify.com/show/0wyxDG8BkClv5XltUiZdbD?si=c6c93c3267684f03&utm_source=newslepear.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=111-how-to-do-dev-tool-linkedin-ads-awesome-reddit-meme-ad-and-dev-tool-brand-archetypes) is out. And I loved how tactical this one was. Itamar knows cold audience LinkedIn Ads… well, cold ;)
#### Why UGC style TikTok ads work
  Bring B2C aesthetics to B2D**. Get inspired by people who actually do good ads that drive entire B2C businesses rather than vanilla B2B ads. 
  In dev tools, you need more than 5 seconds to explain what the product does**. Sometimes way more. TikTok-style video ads with actors catch attention and keep it for long enough so that you can explain what your tool does. 
  Startups should focus on cold audiences** (prospecting). People who never heard of you. This is where the impact comes from not remarketing. 
  * If you do something **inherently exciting, with a free tier, a good in-feed YouTube ads tactic** is to get the influencer to create a piece of content, and distribute that video through in-feed ads. 
  Instagram (Meta) ads can be a great** way to reach engineers. You find your audience by qualification through a creative. For example start with a generic interest based audience, see who watches 75% of your video ads, find lookalikes to those and serve ads to them. But it only works if your **audience on Meta is in 100s of thousands**. 
  “Every ad should show the product”** was a rule at Monday that Itamar has used throughout his career. Even if it is difficult, show the product, talk about the capabilities of the product. 

#### Metrics and optimization
  Optimize ads based on in-platform signals**(view % etc), sanity check with sales that leads coming in are good (pipeline).
  Take big bets and see obvious results** (or not). Small incremental improvements are hard to see. Don’t scale the budget by 10%, scale it 2x. Make it easy to see that you succeeded or failed. 
  Early stage you shouldn’t need any complicated models to see the impact**. If you don’t see spikes it is not working

### 2. Dev tool brand archetypes

I love dev tool branding and I loved this post from Maya. 
She talks about 6 archetypes in tech branding right now:
  Mascots** : well, mascots ;) (Posthog, MotherDuck)
  Whimsy FTW** : hand-drawn, quirky (Notion, fly.io)
  Far to busy building** : Looks like a google doc almost (SSI, San Francisco Compute Company)
  2D Pastel robot overloards** : well pastel colors, 2d (OpenAI, Anthropic)
  “Pioneer this”** : cosmic, illustrations, another planet (Cohere, 11x)

I’d add a few from myself:
  Classic dev minimalist beauty** : dark, minimal, functional (Linear, Resend)
  ASCI** : talked about this [PlanetScale redesign in the issue 108](https://newslepear.beehiiv.com/p/108-great-linkedin-ad-and-behind-the-scenes-of-planetscale-redesign) (PlanetScale, Turbopuffer)
  Retro** : Feels like Windows 95 ([AG2.ai](http://AG2.ai), Big Desk Energy)

Ultimately you want to be memorable, consistent, and build rapport. Anything outside of classic dev minimalist requires way more work.. but is also more fun. Pick your poison wisely.
