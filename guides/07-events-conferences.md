In developer marketing, events provide:
- Face-to-face trust building
- Deep product conversations
- Community relationship building
- Content opportunities (talks, recordings)
- Competitive intelligence

### Event Types

1. **Industry conferences** (KubeCon, AWS re:Invent)
2. **Community meetups** (local tech meetups)
3. **Your own events** (launch events, dinners)
4. **Partner events** (co-hosted with complementary tools)
5. **Virtual events** (webinars, online conferences)

### Booth That Works

**Key elements:**
- Clear value prop visible from distance
- Interactive demo stations
- Swag with purpose (not junk)
- Knowledgeable staff

### Interactive Demos

**Best practice:** Let developers actually use your product at the booth.

Set up:
- Quick demo flow (5-10 minutes max)
- Pre-configured environment
- Success moment they can achieve
- Follow-up capture

### Booth Staff

**Who should work the booth:**
- Engineers who can go deep
- Marketers who can qualify
- Mix of personalities

**Tips:**
- Rotate to prevent burnout
- Brief on key messages
- Set lead capture goals

## Part 3: Zero-Budget Conference Marketing

### The Walking Billboard

**Case study:** "How I marketed to 2,000 prospects for ~$0"

**Approach:**
- Simple t-shirt with value prop + QR code
- Wear it, walk around
- Start conversations

**Why it works:**
- Being dramatically different > incrementally better
- Zero cost, high visibility
- Natural conversation starter

### Custom Demos for Other Vendors

**Tactic:** Build awesome customized demos for other vendors' booths.

**Process:**
1. Reach out to vendors before conference
2. Offer to build demo that uses your product
3. They get great demo content
4. You get exposure

**Results:** One founder got 8/25 replies, 4 ended up doing it.

### Custom Demos for Speakers

**Same approach for speakers:**
- Offer to build demo for their talk
- Their talk features your product naturally
- Higher credibility than booth

## Part 4: Swag Strategy

### Swag That Works

**Principles:**
- Useful > clever
- Connected to product > generic
- Quality > quantity
- Memorable > forgettable

### Swag Ideas That Hit

**Mechanical keyboard with branded key (Parabola):**
- Replace Enter key with logo in brand colors
- Metaphorical: automation → execution
- Useful, memorable, shareable

**Hand-iced cookies with product visuals:**
- Custom cookies with charts from product
- Gives people excuse to share at work
- Triggers Slack conversations

**Coconut water (Datafold):**
- Unexpected
- Practical at hot conferences
- Memorable

### The T-Shirt Formula

**Developer t-shirts should be:**
- Something they'd actually wear
- Not overly promotional
- Clever or technical reference
- Quality fabric

**T-shirt gallery:** Look at devy t-shirt galleries for inspiration.

### Swag Giveaway Campaigns

**Big prize vs. many small prizes:**

One big prize can get better ROI than many small ones.

**NannyML example:** Monitoring tool gave away monitoring setup.
- Went viral
- Connected to product value
- Worth talking about

### Getting Talks Accepted

**Key elements of good proposal:**
1. Clear, specific title

### Talk Content

**What works:**
- Teaching something practical
- Sharing real experience (debugging story)
- Novel technical approach
- Behind-the-scenes of known systems

**What doesn't work:**
- Thinly veiled product pitches
- Too high-level/generic
- Already been done many times

### Promoting Your Talk

Before:

During:

After:
- Share slides
- Post recording when available
- Write blog post version

## Part 6: Hosting Your Own Events

### Small Exclusive Dinners

**The case for small:**

**The CTA:** After the dinner, invite to community Slack.

### Event Registration Promotion

For super important events, the header is the most viewed part of the most visited page.

### Launch Events

**Supabase launch weeks:** Condense announcements to create momentum and mindshare.

**Elements:**

- Community engagement throughout
