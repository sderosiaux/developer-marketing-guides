## Part 1: Community Fundamentals

![08 Community Flywheel](images/08-community-flywheel.png)


### Why Community Matters

Community is the outer ring of developer experience:
**Product → Docs → Content → Community**

As you mature, community becomes crucial for:
- Support at scale
- Product feedback
- Advocacy and word-of-mouth
- Retention and stickiness

### Types of Developer Communities

1. **Support communities** (Slack, Discord)
2. **Discussion forums** (Discourse)
3. **Open source contributors** (GitHub)
4. **Craft communities** (around a practice, not product)

### Community of Craft vs Product Community

**Community of craft:**
- Broader than your product
- Practitioners helping practitioners
- Your product is one of many topics
- Harder to build, more valuable

**Product community:**
- Focused on your users
- Support and feedback
- More directly valuable for product

## Part 2: Starting a Community

### The Cold Start Problem

**Seeding approach (from Demetrios Brinkmann):**

Start by inviting selected people through LinkedIn/Twitter.

**Sample outreach:**
> "Hey I've spent the last 40 days locked in my house [COVID], and wanted to do something productive with my life. And I started this community. If you want to join, let me know"

### First 100 Members

**Get to know people:**
- When people join, talk to them
- Do 15-minute chats
- Learn what they want from community
- Understand their expertise
- Find where they can contribute

### Seeding Conversations

**Tactics:**
- Ask people you spoke to, to ask questions in channels
- Share resources (shows community isn't dead)
- Tag and introduce members based on expertise
- Create reasons for engagement

---

## Part 3: Growing Engagement

### Don't Let Questions Go Unanswered

This is critical. An unanswered question = dead community signal.

**If no one answers:**
- Ask specific people in DMs to answer
- Tag relevant experts
- Share resources you've seen on the topic
- Answer yourself if needed

### Tag and Connect Members

**Based on your 1:1 conversations:**
- Figure out who knows about what
- @ tag them in relevant conversations
- Intro/connect people who should know each other in DMs

### Share Targeted Resources

When you know members' interests:
- Share courses, blogs, podcasts relevant to them specifically
- This is valuable and builds relationship
- Shows you're paying attention

### Build Members Up

**Ways to elevate community members:**
- See their blog post? Share it in Slack, start discussion
- Invite them to meetups/conferences
- Feature them on podcast
- Give them speaking opportunities

### The Be-Shameless Channel

**Why it works:**
- For practitioners, one of most valuable channels
- Keeps people informed on industry
- Vendor articles can be appreciated (they work with practitioners daily)
- Better than spam in #general

---

## Part 4: Community Quality

### Gating the Community

**Why gate access:**
- Discussions shaped by who's in them
- Vendors/beginners = vendor/beginner conversations
- Quality control matters

**Gating approaches:**
- Application form with questions
- Invite-only
- Vouch from existing member
- Company email only

### Managing Spam and Quality

**Separate channels for:**
- Jobs/hiring
- Self-promotion (be-shameless)
- General discussion
- Specific topics

**Moderation:**
- Clear rules visible
- Active moderation
- Community-led enforcement

---

## Part 5: Scaling Community

### From Founder-Led to Team-Led

**Early:** Founder/marketer does everything
**Growing:** Hire community manager
**Scale:** Community team + power users

### Power Users and Champions

**Identify power users:**
- Most helpful in discussions
- Create content
- Advocate externally

**Nurture them:**
- Exclusive access
- Direct line to product
- Recognition
- Opportunities

### Automating Engagement

**Tools like Dots:**
- Automated onboarding flows
- Scalable support
- Trigger-based engagement

But don't over-automate — authenticity matters.

## Part 6: Monetizing Community (Carefully)

### Sponsorship Tricky Balance

**The challenge:**
- Need sponsors to fund infrastructure and people
- Don't want to sell members as leads

**Approaches:**
- Sponsored content with clear labeling
- Sponsored events (not data sharing)
- Sponsored swag

### Community as Lead Source

**Warning:** Don't treat community as lead farm.

**Better approach:**
- Community builds trust
- Trust leads to product exploration
- Exploration leads to conversion

### Value Exchange

**What community gives you:**
- Product feedback
- Content ideas
- Advocates
- Support reduction
- Word of mouth

**What you give community:**
- Value from connections
- Learning opportunities
- Access to experts
- Career development

## Part 7: Platform Choices

### Slack vs Discord

**Slack:**
- Professional feel
- Enterprise-familiar
- Searchable history (paid)
- Integrations with work tools

**Discord:**
- Younger audience
- Voice channels
- Free features
- Gaming-adjacent communities

### Other Platforms

**Discourse:**
- Forum format
- Better for long-form discussions
- Searchable, Google-indexable
- Less real-time

**GitHub Discussions:**
- Native to code
- Good for technical Q&A
- Open source friendly

---

## Part 8: Small Exclusive Events

### The Dinner Format

**Why small and exclusive:**
- 20-30 people max
- Not recorded
- Super focused conversations
- Quality relationships

**Structure:**
- Invite carefully
- Clear topic/theme
- Facilitated discussion
- Strong follow-up

### Building FOMO

Use first attendees to attract more:
> "I'm hosting a dinner with [known person] and [another known person]. Want to join?"

### The Community Funnel

**In-person event → Online community**

After the dinner, the CTA is to join Slack.
Relationship started IRL strengthens online.

## Part 9: Podcasts and Community

### Creating a Podcast Opens Doors

High-influence people take calls when it's a podcast.
They might not otherwise talk to you.

**Community benefits:**
- Content for community
- Status for community
- Guests become community aware

### Podcast as Community Tool

- Interview community members
- Feature their stories
- Answer community questions
- Strengthen relationships

---

## Part 10: Community Metrics

### Engagement Metrics

- Daily/weekly active members
- Messages per member
- Response rate to questions
- Time to first response

### Quality Metrics

- Member retention
- Member satisfaction (survey)
- Help given to each other
- Content generated

### Business Metrics

- Community members → customers
- Support deflection
- Referrals from community
- Feedback implemented
