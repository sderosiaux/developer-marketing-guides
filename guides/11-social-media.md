# Social Media for Developer Tools

A comprehensive guide to social media marketing for developers. From Twitter strategy to LinkedIn thought leadership.

---

## Part 1: Social Media Philosophy

### What Works for Developers

Developers respond to:
- **Authenticity** over polish
- **Value** over promotion
- **Technical depth** over buzzwords
- **Transparency** over marketing speak

### Platform Selection

**Twitter/X:** Tech conversations, developer community
**LinkedIn:** Professional, B2B, decision-makers
**YouTube:** Educational content, tutorials
**Reddit:** Community discussions (organic only)
**Discord:** Community hubs
**Mastodon:** Decentralized, dev-heavy, OSS-friendly

---

## Part 2: Twitter/X Strategy

### Learning from Supabase

Supabase has 28k+ followers with 100+ engagements on regular tweets. Here's why:

**1. Understand your audience**
Craft memes and jokes specifically for developer audience.

**2. Talk in dev jargon**
Don't dumb it down. Speak their language.

**3. Make tweets pop in the feed**
Even enterprise plan promotion can be engaging.

### Tweet Format That Works

**Hook + Validation + Push:**
1. Hook me with a story (to the point, developer speak)
2. Validate with the middle part (showing there will be value)
3. Push to the next tweet or link

### Thread Formula

1. **First tweet:** Hook with story
2. **Middle tweets:** Deliver value
3. **Final tweet:** CTA (link, action, engagement)

### Code Snippets on Twitter

**Tools for beautiful code images:**
- carbon.now.sh (free, basic)
- snappify.io (freemium, more features)

## Part 3: LinkedIn Strategy

### Why LinkedIn Works for Dev Tools

- Engineering managers are there
- CTOs and VPs make decisions
- Enterprise buyers active
- Less noise than Twitter for B2B

### Content Types That Work

**1. Architecture diagrams + explanation**
Devs like diagrams. Complex concept in one visual = shareable.

**2. Personal founder stories**
Behind-the-scenes of building.

**3. Tactical learnings**
"What I learned doing X at [Company]"

**4. Controversial takes**
(Respectfully) challenge conventional wisdom.

### LinkedIn Hacks

- First comment boosts reach
- Ask questions to drive engagement
- Use formatting (bullets, line breaks)
- Post consistently at same time

### The CEO/Founder Playbook

**Why it works:**
Founders have authority developers respect. Technical founders especially.

**Content mix:**
- Company updates (20%)
- Industry insights (30%)
- Personal learnings (30%)
- Engagement with others (20%)

---

## Part 4: Diagrams and Visual Content

### Why Diagrams Go Viral

Diagrams "smell" like value. People share them to:
- Feel smart
- Help their network
- Signal expertise

**Truth:** Less than 2% actually follow the diagram. But they share it because it feels valuable.

### Creating Shareable Diagrams

- Workflow/tool stack diagrams
- Architecture overviews
- Process flows
- Comparison visuals

### Tools for Diagrams

- Excalidraw (hand-drawn style)
- Whimsical (clean, professional)
- Figma (custom design)
- Mermaid (code-based)

---

## Part 5: Founder-Led Social

### Why It Matters

**PostHog insight:** Technical founders being authentic on social creates trust that traditional marketing can't.

### Content Strategy for Founders

**Share:**
- Building journey
- Technical decisions
- Team updates
- Industry perspective
- Authentic struggles

**Avoid:**
- Corporate marketing speak
- Overselling
- Only promotional content

### Consistency Over Perfection

**Better:** Regular, authentic posts
**Worse:** Sporadic, polished content

Build habit around posting schedule.

---

## Part 6: Social Listening

### Why Listen

Understand:
- What developers struggle with
- How they talk about problems
- Competitor perception
- Your brand mentions

### Tools for Listening

- **Syften:** Dev-focused (Twitter, Reddit, HN, Slack)
- **SparkToro:** Audience research
- **Generic tools:** Mention, Brand24

### Acting on Insights

**Comment monitoring:** Great opportunities to help and promote naturally.

**Competitor mentions:** Understand positioning opportunities.

**Pain point discussions:** Content ideas and product feedback.

---

## Part 7: Community Comments

### How to Plug Your Tool in Comments

**Do:**
- Add genuine value first
- Be honest about what you do
- Admit limitations
- Help even when product isn't fit

**Don't:**
- Spam every thread
- Ignore context
- Be defensive
- Oversell

### The Lee Robinson Approach

Lee (Vercel) is masterful at helpful comments that naturally mention the product. Value first, product second.

## Part 8: Social for Launches

### Launch Amplification

**Pre-launch:**
- Tease on social
- Inform community
- Line up supporters

**Launch day:**
- Coordinated team posts
- Engage with every comment
- Cross-platform presence

**Post-launch:**
- Share results
- Thank community
- Continue momentum

### Social for HN/PH

When launching on HN or Product Hunt:
- Announce on social
- Ask for support (carefully)
- Share updates throughout day

---

## Part 9: Video Content

### Raw Video That Works

**Kinde "Timer" video ad:**
- Timer on screen
- Building something with product
- Real-time demonstration
- Feels authentic, not produced

### TikTok-Style Content

Short, punchy videos for LinkedIn:
- 30-60 seconds
- One key message
- Feels native to social
- Not overproduced

### YouTube Presence

For educational content:
- Tutorials
- Deep dives
- Product walkthroughs
- Conference talks

---

## Part 10: Measuring Social

### Metrics That Matter

**Awareness:**
- Impressions
- Reach
- Follower growth

**Engagement:**
- Comments
- Shares
- Saves

**Conversion:**
- Click-throughs
- Signups attributed
- Self-reported mentions

### Self-Reported Attribution

Ask users: "How did you hear about us?"

Social often shows up here when software attribution misses it.

### Don't Obsess Over Vanity

Engagement rate more valuable than raw follower count.
Quality of comments more valuable than quantity.
