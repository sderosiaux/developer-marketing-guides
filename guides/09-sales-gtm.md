# Sales & Go-to-Market for Developer Tools

A comprehensive guide to developer-focused sales motions. From PLG fundamentals to enterprise sales.

## Part 1: Developer GTM Fundamentals

![09 Gtm Approaches](images/09-gtm-approaches.png)

### The Core Truth

Developers don't want to talk to you.

**They prefer:**
- Self-serve exploration
- Documentation over demos
- Trying before buying
- Technical validation over sales pitches

Build your GTM around this reality.

### Bottom-Up vs Top-Down vs Middle-Out

**Bottom-up:**
- Developers adopt → expand within team → enterprise deals
- Classic PLG motion
- Longer but stickier

**Top-down:**
- Sell to CTO/VP → mandate usage
- Faster enterprise deals
- Less organic adoption

**Middle-out:**
- Target engineering managers
- Simultaneously excite devs (product experience) and directors (product value)
- Accelerates purchasing decision

## Part 2: The 1-2-3 GTM Framework (Adam Gross)

### Three Motions, Three Value Props

| Motion | Value Prop Focus | Persona | Metric |
|--------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **1. Free** | Individual developer | Personal productivity | Adoption |
| **2. Self-serve** | Team | Collaboration | MRR |
| **3. Enterprise** | Organization | Compliance, scale | ACV |

### Motion 1: Free

**Focus:** Developer value proposition
**Goal:** Adoption, habit formation
**Measurement:** Active users, engagement

### Motion 2: Self-Serve

**Focus:** Team value proposition (collaboration)
**Goal:** Revenue from self-upgrade
**Measurement:** MRR, team expansion

### Motion 3: Enterprise

**Focus:** Organization value proposition (compliance, security, scale)
**Goal:** Large ACV deals
**Measurement:** ACV, expansion

---

## Part 3: Product-Led Sales

### What is Product-Led Sales?

Sales that happens AFTER users experience product value.

**Not:** Cold outreach to strangers
**Instead:** Warm outreach to engaged users

### Who to Reach Out To

**From Ben Williams (PLG advisor):**

1. Identify account engaged beyond activity threshold
2. Verify it's your ideal customer profile
3. Find the BUYER persona in that account
4. Reach out to the buyer, NOT the developer end-user

**Critical insight:** Don't burn channels trying to get developers to "hop on a quick call." It rarely works.

### When NOT to Reach Out

**Avoid:** Free trialists who churned and never really used product.

You'll lose 50-70% of free trials. Those aren't the ones to engage.

**Engage:** Users actually using the product, especially those who:
- Are stuck (can help)
- Are likely to pay more (expansion signal)

---

## Part 4: Sales Signals

![09 Sales Signals Dashboard](images/09-sales-signals-dashboard.png)

### Big List of Sales Signals

Combine signals from:
- Product usage
- Docs activity
- Website behavior
- Community (Slack, Discord)
- GitHub repos
- Social media

**Product signals:**
- Usage above threshold
- Team expansion
- Enterprise feature exploration
- Pricing page visits

**Website signals:**
- Terms of service views
- Security/compliance page visits
- Contact us clicks
- Multiple stakeholders visiting

**Community signals:**
- Technical questions indicating serious eval
- Mentions of decision timeline
- Requests for enterprise features

**External signals:**
- Funding announcements
- Hiring for relevant roles
- Competitor mentions

### Using Signals Effectively

1. **Score signals** (high/medium/low intent)
2. **Combine signals** for confidence
3. **Time outreach** to signal clusters
4. **Personalize based on signal** ("I saw you were exploring...")

---

## Part 5: The Developer Journey

### Journey Stages

**1. Discover**
- How do they find you?
- Channels: Search, community, word of mouth

**2. Start**
- First interaction with product
- Key: Time to first Hello World

**3. Activate**
- First value moment
- Aha moment definition

**4. Convert**
- Free to paid
- Individual to team

**5. Scale**
- Team to enterprise
- Expansion triggers

### Mapping Signals to Journey

**Discover → Start:** SEO, ads, community mentions
**Start → Activate:** Docs visits, quickstart completion
**Activate → Convert:** Pricing page, team features explored
**Convert → Scale:** Usage growth, enterprise feature requests

---

## Part 6: Enterprise Sales

### Enterprise Value Props

Different from developer value props:
- **Compliance** (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Security** (SSO, audit logs)
- **Scale** (SLAs, support)
- **Control** (self-hosting, data residency)

### The Internal Sale

Developers need to sell your tool to others.

**Help them with:**
- Use case pages (for less technical buyers)
- Enterprise features visibility
- "Convince your boss" content pack:
  - Value prop summary
  - Feature comparison
  - Case studies
  - ROI calculator
  - Email templates

### Enterprise Outreach

**From Datadog CMO:**

Marketing role in outbound:
- Product marketing (positioning)
- Enablement
- "Giving excuses to meet enterprise prospects"

**Tactic for startups:** Build circle of influence within champion/buyer community. Host small dinners for peers (CTOs at e-commerce, etc.). Use first attendees to create FOMO.

---

## Part 7: Pipeline Building

### Pipeline Sources

Typically 4 sources:
1. **Inbound** (marketing)
2. **BDR/SDR** (sales development)
3. **AE** (account executives)
4. **Partner/Channel** (partnerships)

**Best practice:** Monthly pipeline review where marketing, sales, and partnerships come together.

### What Works for Inbound (from Datadog)

- Paid media (Google, LinkedIn)
- Webinar programs
- Third-party events
- Organic content (SEO-heavy)

### Marketing Metrics for Sales

**Core metrics to own:**
- MQLs (awareness proxy when MQL→Opp conversion is stable)
- Opportunities
- Pipeline value
- Win rate

---

## Part 8: Attribution and Alignment

### The Attribution Trick

**From Datadog CMO:**

Together with sales, go through a couple of enterprise customer journeys including all marketing touches and sales engagement.

**Do this quarterly.**

Result: GTM org appreciates contributions from different teams, fights less about source attribution.

### Marketing and Sales Alignment

**Information flow is critical:**
- Marketing needs to know what sales hears
- Sales needs to know what marketing sees
- Joint pipeline reviews
- Shared definitions

---

## Part 9: Selling to Developers Specifically

### What Works

- **Help, don't sell:** Focus on solving their problem
- **Technical depth:** They'll test your knowledge
- **Transparency:** Acknowledge tradeoffs
- **Hands-on:** Let them try

### What Doesn't Work

- Cold calls asking for "quick chat"
- Generic nurture emails
- High-pressure tactics
- Overselling capabilities

### The Build vs Buy Conversation

Developers often prefer "build then buy."

**From HN discussion:**
> "Buy-then-build can be a great strategy. Going into a decision with the mindset readiness for 'then-build', you can learn from existing products, hit their limits and understand what the custom version you'll need."

**Implication:** Position as something they could build but shouldn't. Make build cost clear.

---

## Part 10: Budget and Resources

### Budget Allocation (from Datadog CMO)

- **Pipeline vs brand:** 70% pipeline generation, 30% brand awareness
- **Headcount vs program:** 50/50
- **Digital vs events:**
  - SMB: 70% digital, 30% events
  - Enterprise: 30% digital, 70% events
- **Marketing % of budget:** 7-9% typical, higher for PLG (~20% at Datadog)

### Building the Team

**For PLG:**
- Growth/product marketing
- Developer advocates
- Content creators

**For enterprise:**
- Field marketing
- SDR/BDR team
- Solutions engineers
