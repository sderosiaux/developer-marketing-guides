# Paid Advertising for Developer Tools

A comprehensive guide to running effective paid ads for developer audiences. From fundamentals to advanced channel-specific tactics.

---

## Part 1: Foundational Principles

### The Developer Advertising Truth

Developers are different. Traditional B2B tactics often fail.

**Core principles:**
- Focus on relevance and practicality over snappy copy
- Spend time on targeting the right people
- Filter places where your ads will be shown
- Don't try to impress — try to help

> "Don't try to impress us, try to help us. Don't make it feel like marketing. Let us get our hands dirty with your product." — From Kelsey Hightower's discussion on what marketing works on developers

### What Developers Respond To

- **Practical value over polish**
- **Authentic education over corporate messaging**
- **Hands-on product experience**
- **Transparency and utility**
- **Problem-solving over persuasion**

### When Paid Ads Make Sense

1. **Capturing existing demand** — People searching for solutions
2. **Retargeting engaged users** — Bringing back those who showed interest
3. **Awareness in niche communities** — Reaching developers where they gather
4. **Scaling what organically works** — Amplifying proven messages

## Part 2: Channel Selection Framework

### How to Evaluate a Channel

Ask three questions (Adam Grenier framework):

Use developer humor that resonates with the subreddit culture. Must feel native, not corporate.

Share genuinely useful information with subtle product mention.

**3. The Direct Pitch (when relevant)**
For solution-aware audiences, direct pitches work if honest.

Short, punchy videos that feel native to social rather than "produced."

**3. Architecture diagrams + explanation**

**Two main approaches:**
1. **Ads:** Pre-roll, in-feed
2. **Sponsorships:** Influencer integrations

### YouTube In-Feed Ads

B2B pricing tips example showed in-feed ads performing well for dev tools — appearing in YouTube search results alongside tutorials.

### YouTube Influencer Playbook (Clerk Masterclass)

**How to work with dev influencers:**

1. **Identify influencers**
   - Start with who you already know
   - Look at who creates content in your space
   - Check engagement, not just subscribers

2. **Outreach**
   - Be direct about what you want
   - Explain why you're reaching out to them specifically
   - Have a clear budget range

3. **Integration types:**
   - Dedicated video (most expensive, highest impact)
   - Sponsored segment (30-90 seconds in existing video)
   - Integration (natural product use in tutorial)

4. **What to look for:**
   - Authenticity
   - Audience match
   - Previous sponsor experience
   - Production quality

5. **Measurement:**

## Part 6: Newsletter Sponsorships

### Why Newsletter Sponsorships Work

- Highly engaged audiences
- Trust transfer from creator
- Contextual relevance
- Less banner blindness

### What Great Newsletter Ads Look Like

**Trieve example in Cassidy Williams newsletter:**

Structure:
1. **"What is it"** — No-fluff product description, HN-style
2. **"What it compares to"** — Anchor to known tool
3. **"Why should I care"** — Value proposition with live demo
4. **"How can I test it"** — Free credits offer

**Key traits:**
- Written by/for devs
- To the point
- Offers try-before-buy

### Newsletter Sponsorship Tips

## Part 7: Developer Ad Networks

### Ethical Ads

Developer-focused ad network. Key learnings:

**Following their guidelines works:**
One company saw 6x improvement in CTR by following Ethical Ads' creative guidelines.

**Best practices:**
- Use their recommended formats
- Keep copy developer-focused
- Context matters — ads appear on dev sites

### Carbon Ads

Similar to Ethical Ads but different network of sites.

### Comparison Tables in Ads

**Format that works:** Show feature comparison table as ad creative. Devs like to see concrete differences.

---

## Part 8: Retargeting

### Retargeting for Developers

While gated content underperforms with devs, retargeting works for maintaining top-of-mind awareness.

### What to Retarget With

**Middle-of-funnel content:**
- Docs
- Integration quickstarts
- Case studies
- Video tutorials

Not: gated ebooks, webinar registrations

### Retargeting Strategy

1. **Website visitors** → Show docs/quickstarts
2. **Doc readers** → Show integration guides
3. **Integration explorers** → Show case studies
4. **Engaged but not converted** → Show sandbox/trial

---

## Part 9: Measuring Ad Performance

### Optimization Goals

For awareness: optimize for content consumption
- Video views
- Time on site
- Scroll depth

For demand capture: optimize for signups/leads
- Trial signups
- Demo requests
- Docs visits

### Self-Reported Attribution

**Why it matters:** Software attribution misses much developer behavior (dark social, word of mouth).

**How to implement:**
- "How did you hear about us?" on signup
- Use open text, not dropdowns (better data)
- Combine with software attribution for full picture

**Advanced tricks:**
- Add "fake" option to measure baseline noise
- Run lift tests: scale one channel while keeping others constant

### Budget Allocation Rules of Thumb

From Datadog CMO:
- 70% pipeline generation / 30% brand awareness
- Headcount vs program: 50/50
- Digital vs events: 70/30 for SMB, 30/70 for enterprise
- PLG companies: higher marketing % of budget (~20%)

## Part 10: Ad Creative Principles

### What Works for Developer Ads

1. **Relevance over cleverness** — Solve their problem
2. **Authenticity** — Don't pretend to be what you're not
3. **Code/technical elements** — Make it feel "devy"
4. **Clear value proposition** — What do I get?
5. **Easy next step** — Try it now, read docs

### Ad Creative Inspiration

Feels authentic, not produced.
